Simple webapp for clustering mediacloud data using Perl Cluto bindings.  
At present, only the http api is working.  Supposing the app is running
on localhost:3000, visiting localhost:3000/date/2008-08-25/n/10 would 
return a json object mapping cluster ids (0 through 10) to lists of cluster
members for the given date.  Such queries take about 48 seconds on average. 

The most troublesome dependency is Statistics::Cluto which can be a bit 
troublesome to install.

TODO:
+ Finish html interface.
+ Process more of Cluto's output.
+ Visalize.
+ Cache results.
