TITLE: Mom&#146;s letter in Placer baby-shaking case triggers mistrial motion


TEXT:


The attorney for a nanny accused of shaking a Roseville baby and causing fatal brain injuries has asked a Placer County judge to declare a mistrial.
Mary Beth Acton, lawyer for Veronica Martinez Salcedo, said in a written motion to the court Monday that a political letter written by the baby's mother was in a congressional candidate's campaign mailer and that it has essentially convicted her client before the trial has been completed.
Acton said the letter from Lorena Juceam amounted to "jury tampering" because members of the jury in Martinez Salcedo's current trial may have received the campaign literature from Doug Ose, who is running for the 4th Congressional District seat. 
She called it a "clear and blatant violation of (the) defendant's right to a fair trial and due process."
Placer Superior Court Judge Colleen Nichols, who is presiding over Martinez Salcedo's trial, is being asked to dismiss the case.
Placer Deputy District Attorney Jeff Wood, who along with Karin Bjork is prosecuting the case, declined to comment, saying he had not read the motion.
Lorena Juceam was unavailable Monday, but her husband, Scott, said his wife's letter had nothing to do with the trial and was sent to "all new moms in Placer County."
"It does not mention Veronica or anything else," he said. "We took great care in drafting the letter and who it was sent to."
The letter, dated May 23, says, "Dear friend, You may remember hearing about my beautiful 16-month-old daughter, Hannah. She was shaken to death by a babysitter two years ago."
The letter goes on to criticize Ose's opponent in the 4th District race, state Sen. Tom McClintock, over an alleged lack of support for child protection legislation.
The letter doesn't mention Ose, nor does it endorse him.
Doug Elmets, a spokesman for Ose, said the letter was included in campaign material to educate voters about issues important to the Juceams and to parents in the 4th Congressional District.
Stan Devereux, a spokesman for the McClintock campaign, said the senator had no comment, citing the ongoing trial involving the Juceams.
Martinez Salcedo is in her second trial on a charge of assault on a child causing death. Prosecutors allege she shook Hannah Rose Juceam so violently on May 11, 2006, that it caused fatal brain injuries.
Prosecutors say the defendant gave four different accounts of the incident, including one in which she said she shook the baby.
Acton said her client shook the baby only lightly and that Hannah may have had an illness or the injuries may have occurred at the hands of others before the day on which Martinez Salcedo was watching the child.
The current trial is in its second month.
A first trial last year ended in a mistrial when jurors deadlocked at 10-2 in favor of conviction. About the writer: Call The Bee's Art Campos, (916) 773-2825.

TITLE: Rancho Cordova man fatally shot while walking


TEXT:


An 18-year-old Rancho Cordova man was shot and killed Wednesday night in Rancho Cordova, authorities said. The shooting occurred shortly before 8:30 p.m. in the 3400 block of Viking Drive, off Bradshaw Road, according to Sacramento County sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Tim Curran.
Rancho Cordova police officers and sheriff's deputies arrived to find the victim lying on the sidewalk with at least one gunshot wound to his upper body, Curran said. The victim, whose name has not been released, was later pronounced dead at the scene. Sheriff's officials said the victim was walking on Viking Drive when he was approached by two men. After a brief verbal exchange, one of the men took out a pistol and fired several shots, officials said.
Witnesses provided investigators varying descriptions of the two men. Anyone with information about the shooting is urged to call Crime Alert at (916) 443-HELP. Callers can remain anonymous and may be eligible for a reward of up to $1,000.

TITLE: Health clinics, policing are on chopping block


TEXT:


Sacramento County officials face grim choices in bringing a budget that is $123.7 million in the red back into balance by June 30.
Under the budget proposal unveiled Friday, the county faces the prospect of closing health clinics and community centers, curtailing funds to truancy centers and battered women's shelters, as well as cutting public safety and services.
Even dipping into more than $55 million in reserve funds will not prevent the county from needing to make $67.9 million in cuts to social service programs and county agencies, including $5 million from the Sheriff's Department's $360 million budget for 2008-09. 
The daunting size of the cuts promises to make county budget hearings that begin June 10 emotional.
"We are going to have to be making some tough decisions," Supervisor Roberta MacGlashan said. "I'm not sure our chambers will accommodate everyone who will want to be there."
The board will hold four days of hearings before adopting a balanced budget by June 30.
The widening deficit stems from steep declines in property and sales taxes, officials said, as well as decreased federal and state aid.
County Executive Terry Schutten's proposed budget calls for $2.2 billion in general fund spending. The county's total budget, including self-funding programs such as the airport, comes to $5.24 billion.
The budget doesn't call for laying off county employees, although 85 workers will be transferred to different county jobs.
The proposal calls for a reduction of 300 positions, a 2 percent decrease in the work force of 14,500. The county's authorized work force has hardly changed in recent years. In 2004, the county had 14,285 positions. After the 2 percent cut, the 2008-09 work force will be down to 14,256.
While some might suggest the county has erred by not laying off workers, as the city of Sacramento has done, experts said savings through pink slips isn't that easy.
Paul McIntosh, executive director of the California Association of Counties, said state and federal laws, as well as employee contracts, make layoffs a slow process.
Seniority rules result in the higher-priced, more experienced staff members staying on at the expense of less experienced and less expensive employees, McIntosh said.
"It's a significant administrative process," McIntosh said. "You don't achieve the savings you thought."
Peter Detwiler, staff director for the California State Senate's Committee on Local Government, said counties  whose main role is to implement state policy  have few options.
"In tough budget times, public officials only have three choices: raise revenue, cut costs or shift the pain," Detwiler said.
In the county's case, shifting the pain means taking funds from social service programs. Women Escaping a Violent Environment officials said the shelter was caught off guard when it learned it would be losing $538,000 in the proposed budget.
Other programs on the chopping block include: three county health clinics, the county's mental health court and county funding for an Oak Park community center.
Some proposed changes wouldn't be immediately obvious to the public. One recommendation is to reduce foster home inspections from once a year to once every five years.
Sheriff John McGinness said he'll fight the county's proposed $5 million in cuts from his department. He said the cuts could jeopardize valued programs such as the gang unit, problem-oriented policing and the high-impact motorcycle unit.
"I'm going to go to the board to see if somehow the $5 million piece can be restored," McGinness said.
If the cut goes through, McGinness said he'll be unable to proceed with hiring 41 officers.
He said he'd try to find savings, but cutting beat cops to save the gang unit would be like cutting emergency room doctors to save a preventative care unit.
"I really want to prioritize those. They have been really effective. I don't want to eliminate them," McGinness said.
He said he recognizes that other important programs also face cuts, but his job is to make the county as safe as possible.
"We are running so lean already, it really represents a significant challenge to operate at the same level," he said. About the writer: Call The Bee's Ed Fletcher, (916) 321-1269.

TITLE: Schwarzenegger, Shriver name new California Hall of Fame inductees


TEXT:


Between Dave Brubeck's piano jazz, Quincy Jones' musical repertoire and Alice Waters' inventive cuisine, the California Hall of Fame can throw one heck of a party.
Especially considering actor Jack Nicholson will have a front-row seat.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and first lady Maria Shriver on Wednesday announced the third class of California Hall of Fame inductees, which includes legends as varied as actress-activist Jane Fonda, author Theodor Geisel ("Dr. Seuss") and two-time Nobelist Linus Pauling. Also making the cut were sculptor Robert Graham, fitness guru Jack LaLanne, photographer Dorothea Lange, architect Julia Morgan and former Gov. Leland Stanford. 
The new inductees will enter the Hall of Fame on Dec. 10 at the California Museum in Sacramento, and all living nominees must agree to attend as a condition of their induction. After the ceremony, the museum will display artifacts from their lives.
Officials at the California Arts Council and the California Museum selected the Hall of Fame class, with consultation from historians such as former state Librarian Kevin Starr. Schwarzenegger and Shriver, who spearheaded the Hall of Fame idea, approved the final decisions.
When the California Hall of Fame began in 2006, Starr compiled a list of about 180 historical figures he thought worthy.
"For instance, the state was different because Leland Stanford helped organize the railroad, was governor during the Civil War and established Stanford University," Starr said.
Fonda is perhaps the most controversial pick. The two-time Oscar winner still rankles some Americans for her trip to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War in 1972, an anti-war protest that earned her the nickname "Hanoi Jane." She later said that sitting on an anti-aircraft gun was "the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine."
"It would have been more appropriate to name to the California Hall of Fame someone from California who won the Medal of Honor than someone who undermined our troops in a foreign war," said Mike Spence, president of the conservative California Republican Assembly. "The governor put Hollywood in front of heroism by making this kind of pick."
Starr acknowledged that Hall of Fame picks always invite debate, particularly the contemporary choices.
"Personally, I don't share her politics," Starr said, "but I think each person should be judged by the total arc of his or her career." About the writer: Call Kevin Yamamura, Bee Capitol Bureau, (916) 326-5548.

TITLE: Geometry easy as pi for Sac City's grads


TEXT:


A new requirement that all graduates pass geometry in the Sacramento City Unified School District hasn't caused nearly the mathematical earthquake that algebra did.
About 2,500 seniors are graduating from city high schools in ceremonies this week and next. The class of 2008 is the first that had to complete geometry to graduate. Nearly all district seniors passed the geometry hurdle, Associate Superintendent Mary Shelton said Thursday.
In a growing trend, the Folsom Cordova Unified School District also is considering adding a geometry requirement for graduating seniors. 
In Sacramento City Unified, exact numbers of students stymied by geometry were not available as of Thursday. But reports from principals indicated their ranks ranged from a few students in the larger high schools to no students in the district's new small campuses.
"It is up in the air for only a few kids," Shelton said, noting that students had four years to meet the new requirement. "Most of our seniors had mastered geometry before their senior year."
The picture was much different four years ago when a state requirement for passing algebra took hold in public high schools. At the time, Sacramento City Unified had hundreds of students still struggling to pass algebra 1 well into their senior year. Geometry has not brought such difficulties, Shelton said.
"Many more students find algebra more challenging than geometry," she said. "It's easier to relate geometry to the real world."
The state's high school exit exam and other senior requirements were more likely to keep students from graduating on time, she added.
Requiring algebra, geometry and higher levels of math is a growing trend across California and the nation. The push is toward greater rigor, said Henry Kepner, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in Reston, Va.
"There's been quite a change," Kepner said. "More and more places are moving away from general math over the last 10 years."
In California, districts have been ramping up the math they require to match the entrance requirements of California State University and the University of California. Both systems require at least three years of math  including algebra 1, geometry and algebra 2  for admission.
To ease the way in the Folsom Cordova district for potential new requirements, administrators are considering a two-tiered approach where students can take either a college preparatory geometry course, or an easier "applied geometry" course tied to vocational or career-technical preparation. Skills learned in geometry are important to many careers that do not require college, such as the construction trades, said Janie DeArcos, assistant superintendent for secondary instruction.
"We want to graduate everyone," DeArcos said. "If you add another high-powered class as a requirement, some students might not make it."
The Elk Grove Unified School District required geometry as a condition of graduating starting in the mid-1990s, said Anne Zeman, Elk Grove's director of curriculum and professional learning. But the district dropped the requirement about four years ago when data showed students were not meeting the state's and district's tougher new standards in the subject.
Elk Grove discovered it needed to build a stronger math foundation in the earlier grades before high school students could succeed, Zeman said. "We decided to pull back the graduation requirement until we could guarantee success," she said.
Currently about 80 percent of Elk Grove's graduates complete geometry. Eventually, the district plans to bring back the geometry requirement for all.
In Sacramento city schools, the geometry requirement has led to a positive ripple effect, said Annette Manolis, vice principal for curriculum at Hiram Johnson High School. In a number of cases, she said, students who might not otherwise have enrolled in geometry went on to take an even tougher algebra 2 class.

TITLE: Crew making sure home's 2nd fire is out


TEXT:


SACRAMENTO  Firefighters are making sure a blaze is completely out at a Country Club- area house  for the second time in three days.
The fire was reported about 6 a.m. Wednesday at the sprawling ranch-style house in the 3200 block of Pope Avenue.
The home also was set ablaze Monday night, causing $150,000 in damage. The two-alarm fire destroyed the garage and damaged a portion of the house. 
Wednesday's fire was not a rekindling of the Monday night blaze, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Capt. Jeff Lynch said.
"Evidence indicates that it was a separate fire," he said. "We are looking very strongly into the possibility it was arson."
The latest fire started in the attic of the home. When firefighters arrived, it had burned through the roof with 20- to 30-foot-high flames. While officials have yet to estimate the cost of damage in Wednesday's blaze, the combination of the two fires severely damaged the house.
"It has definitely been rendered uninhabitable," Lynch said.

TITLE: Hit-and-run suspect will face trial


TEXT:


A Placer County judge ordered today that a Folsom woman will face a felony trial for the death last year of a 15-year-old Granite Bay girl who was struck while walking on the side of the road by a hit-and-run driver.
Superior Court Judge Larry D. Gaddis said following a preliminary hearing for defendant Anna Elvira Berset, 51, that there was sufficient reason to proceed to a trial on a felony charge of hit-and-run driving causing death and a misdemeanor count of manslaughter without gross negligence. He set trial for Sept. 15.
Killed in the June 13 incident was Courtney Parker, a Granite Bay High School student and former cheerleader who had just completed her freshman year. 
Parker was walking with a friend along Auburn Folsom Road near Robin Hood Way after 10 p.m. when a vehicle behind them reportedly veered from the roadway and struck her, sending her 70 yards from the point of impact, according to law enforcement officials who investigated the case.
California Highway Patrol Officer Mark Williams testified that Berset called his office the next morning to report that she had struck something on Auburn Folsom Road the previous night.
"She believed that kids might have tossed something at her, maybe a trash can," Williams said, adding that she also mentioned possibly hitting a deer.
When officers went to her home, they found extensive damage to the hood, headlight, windshield and right side of her 2002 Toyota RAV4. An evidence technician collected a DNA sample from a spot on the vehicle and it matched that of Courtney Parker, a DNA analyst from the state testified.
No evidence was found by the CHP that Berset had been drinking prior to the accident, although she was driving home from a gathering in Auburn where alcohol had been served. About the writer: Call The Bee's Art Campos, (916) 773-2825.

TITLE: Rocklin will add another red-light camera


TEXT:


Rocklin will install a second camera Friday to snap photos of red-light runners in the city.
The camera has been installed at the intersection of westbound Rocklin Road at the onramp and offramp from westbound Interstate 80. The city's other camera at Sunset Boulevard and Park Avenue was installed in 2006.
Police Sgt. Terry Roide said motorists will be given a 30-day warning period at the new camera location before citations are issued. Enforcement is set for July 7, he said. 
Citations will be sent to the alleged violators, who can either pay the fine listed on the ticket or challenge the citation in court.
Roide said in a news release that the cameras are steps to improve the safety and flow of local traffic.
In 2007, the camera at Sunset and Park captured 1,074 red-light violations, and 765 of those motorists received citations, he said.
Rocklin's photo enforcement program is administered by Redflex Traffic Systems Inc., an Arizona company. Rocklin pays Redflex $6,000 a month per camera in a lease agreement to administer the system.
Police Chief Mark Siemens said fines levied against the red-light runners generally pay for the cost. He said the city has made little or no revenue from the enforcement program.
"Our first camera has pretty much been a break-even operation," he said. About the writer: Call The Bee's Art Campos, (916) 773-2825.

TITLE: Teen farmworker's death, probed as heat-related, stirs outcry


TEXT:


Until her death on May 16, Maria Isabel Vasquez Jimenez was another undocumented farmworker at the bottom rung of California's farm production chain.
On Wednesday, nestled in a white satin coffin, the 17-year-old girl became to farm labor advocates more a symbol of what they say are secretive and abusive conditions in some of the state's orchards and vineyards.
California occupational safety authorities are investigating the girl's death in Lodi as a heat-related fatality. The United Farm Workers Union is calling her treatment an "egregious" violation of safety regulations put into effect three years ago after three farmworkers and a construction worker died of the heat. 
"Maria's death should have been prevented," Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon.
Earlier in the day he met with the young woman's family at St. Anne's Catholic Church in Lodi after a funeral Mass. "This land gave us a lot of opportunity but gave her death. And we have to make sure this doesn't happen again," Schwarzenegger said.
Vasquez Jimenez and her fiancé, Florentino Bautista, were working in a vineyard east of Stockton on May 14 when she collapsed. The pair were employed by Merced Farm Labor contracting service out of Atwater.
In a phone interview, Merced Farm Labor safety officer Elias Armenta said, "We are really, really sorry" about the teenager's death. "Unfortunately, we cannot make any other comment."
Under rules enforced by Cal-OSHA, each worker is supposed to be provided one quart of water per shift. Employers are required to provide shaded areas and allow workers to take five-minute breaks as necessary to cool down. Bosses also have to train their supervisors and employees and have a written program ready for inspection if Cal-OSHA officials request one.
Cal-OSHA inspectors already have interviewed Bautista and others about the incident, said division spokesman Dean Fryer.
He said time is of the essence because "these are farmworkers, and they might move on."
Fryer said that employers who are found to have willfully violated heat laws can be fined a maximum of $25,000. The San Joaquin County District Attorney's Office will receive a copy of the division's report and can make a decision to prosecute.
When Vasquez Jimenez collapsed, she had been on the job three days, pruning vines for $8 an hour in a vineyard owned by West Coast Grape Farming.
During eight hours of work beginning at 6 a.m. in heat that topped 95 degrees, Bautista said that workers were given only one water break, at 10:30 a.m. And the water was a 10-minute walk away  too far, he said, to keep up with the crew and avoid being scolded.
Vasquez Jimenez collapsed at 3:30 p.m., Bautista said, and for at least five minutes, the foreman did nothing but stare at the couple while Bautista cradled her.
Bautista said the foreman told him to place the teenager in the back seat of a van, which was hot inside, and put a wet cloth on her.
Later, Bautista said, the foreman told a driver to take the pair to a store to buy rubbing alcohol and apply it to see if it would revive Vasquez Jimenez. When that failed, the driver took the couple to a clinic in Lodi, Bautista said, where her body temperature had reached more than 108 degrees.
"The foreman told me to say that she wasn't working for a contractor, that she got sick while exercising," Bautista said in Spanish. "He said she was underage, and it would cause a lot of problems."
Bautista and family members said that clinic staff rushed the girl to a hospital, where she was revived several times before finally succumbing two days later without ever regaining consciousness. Doctors later discovered she was two months pregnant.
UFW President Arturo Rodriguez delivered a eulogy in Spanish at the Lodi church Wednesday.
"What value does a farmworker's life have? Is it less than the life of any other human?" he said.
He announced that the UFW will join the family in a four-day march from Lodi to Sacramento in Vasquez Jimenez's honor starting Sunday. They will urge punishment for those responsible for her death.
Schwarzenegger, who strongly backed rules to prevent farmworker heat deaths, walked into the church Wednesday with Rodriguez.
Once inside, he placed his hand on Bautista's shoulder as the young man described Vasquez Jimenez, who was his sweetheart from the same Mixtec Indian town in Oaxaca, Mexico.
She wanted to earn money to send to her widowed mother, Bautista said. The couple planned to marry and return to Oaxaca in three years. She may not have known she was pregnant.
"I'm sure she was a good woman," the governor said. He walked over to gaze into Vasquez Jimenez's casket, where she was dressed in a white wedding gown and veil, a symbol of her dream to be a bride. About the writer: Call The Bee's Susan Ferriss, (916) 321-1267.

City officials said the entities -- the Art in Public Places Committee the most prominent among them -- were disbanded because the commission doesn't have the legal authority to pass on duties to subgroups. 
The art in public places committee played the lead role in matching artists to public art projects.
The Arts Commission will have more on its plate, but will be otherwise unaffected by the move, Sacramento City Clerk Shirley Concolino said.

TITLE: El Dorado County balances budget - for now


TEXT:


El Dorado County officials are holding budget workshops next week with the caveat that their efforts to balance projected revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year could be undone by the state.
Laura Gill, county chief administrative officer, presented the Board of Supervisors earlier this week with a proposed 2008-09 budget totaling $556 million - $61 million, or nearly 10 percent, less than the final 2007-08 budget.
But she cautioned the county's fiscal fortunes are linked to what happens in Sacramento as legislators try to balance the state budget. 
"What's going to be very important to monitor through the next three months is what happens at the state level," she said.
The county's proposed budget includes a $220 million general fund budget, which is $11 million, or nearly 5 percent, less than the final general fund budget for the fiscal year ending June 30.
The decrease in anticipated general fund revenues, Gill said, is due in part to the slowdown in the housing market. The county anticipates 5 percent growth in property tax revenues, compared with 11 percent to 15 percent in years past.
The decrease in projected expenditures reflects cost-cutting actions taken earlier this year.
Gill noted that the board cut positions in several departments and approved reorganization of the General Services Department, now known as the Facilities and Fleet Department.
The proposed general fund budget shows a net reduction of 2.15 employee positions.
Fifteen positions are to be added to the Sheriff's Department. The budget proposes continuing the board's commitment to add three deputies a year to handle growth in the west end of the county, primarily El Dorado Hills and Cameron Park.
Seven deputies also are to be hired to provide law enforcement services related to the Indian casino scheduled to open on the Shingle Springs Rancheria late this year.
Although the county will continue to draw on fund balances to support ongoing operations, Gill said the proposed budget would use $4 million in fund balance in the coming fiscal year, compared with $12 million in 2007-08.
"That's a significant step in the right direction," she said.
The general fund budget also includes 8 percent in "rainy day" reserves.
Gill stressed that 8 percent - enough to cover a month of operational costs - is the minimum standard. Any increase in the fund balance, she said, should be placed in reserve for 2009-10.
"The 2009-10 outlook, quite frankly, is poor," she said.
Projections indicate the county could face a $14 million deficit in 2009-10, and an $11 million deficit the following year.
County officials said they fear the greatest threat to the county's fiscal well being is the state budget crisis.
"Our biggest business partner is insolvent," said auditor-controller Joe Harn, noting that much of the county's revenue is funneled through the state.
County officials say they fear the Legislature will either use tax revenues that typically go to local governments to balance the state budget, or delay reimbursements to counties for required services.
Some supervisors questioned Harn's decision not to apply for tax revenue anticipation notes to help cover costs if the state delays payments for state-funded programs.
The county could attempt to cover the interest due on the borrowed funds through arbitrage. But Harn said the Internal Revenue Service has targeted California municipalities because they are making too much money in arbitrage.
Borrowing the funds could subject the county to an IRS audit, which would be expensive and time consuming, he said.
Supervisor Ron Briggs argued that the county ought to borrow the money as a precaution.
Briggs said it has been his experience that "it's better to do things when you can, not when you have to."
Supervisor Jack Sweeney said he feared delays in state funding would present serious cash flow problems in the coming fiscal year.
"I felt we needed the (tax revenue anticipation notes) maybe to keep that state deficit truck from hitting us," he said.
Harn said he believed the county had adequate fund balances to maintain the necessary cash flow.
"I'm confident we can get through 2008-09 without borrowing," he said.
Budget workshops will begin Monday and continue through June 13. The board is scheduled to adopt a proposed budget June 17 and a final budget in September.

TITLE: City officials say no to allowing bikes along K Street Mall


TEXT:


Sacramento city officials Tuesday backed away from a plan to temporarily allow cyclists on pedestrian K Street Mall.
Transportation planners had wanted the City Council to OK bikes on the mall for six weeks to allow bike commuters safer access to offices during upcoming closures on Interstate 5.
The closures are expected to prompt more cycling commuters and more congestion on city streets. 
City police officials balked, however, saying they worry that tossing cyclists into the mix of pedestrians on the mall -- with little notice -- would create a safety hazard.
"Without a designed bike lane, the safety concerns, for us, outweigh the benefit," police spokesman Matt Young said.
Young said police and transportation officials will discuss possible compromises Wednesday.
Downtown worker and new cyclist Pati Brown -- one of the people who suggested the mall bike idea -- said she hopes the city makes some sort of temporary accommodations.
"I'm a novice, and it is very scary to be on I or J without a bike lane," Brown said.

TITLE: UC Davis Chancellor Vanderhoef to step down next year


TEXT:


The University of California, Davis, turns 100 next year  and when the parties end, so will the leadership of Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef.
The man who has been at the helm of UC Davis since 1994 announced Monday that he will be stepping down from his post in a year. Vanderhoef plans to take a one-year sabbatical before returning to campus as a professor of plant biology.
"I've got a lot of practicing to do," Vanderhoef said of his return to the classroom after so many years in university administration. 
UC officials said they will conduct a nationwide search for a chancellor.
Vanderhoef, 67, led UC Davis through a period of explosive growth. Enrollment grew from 22,000 to 30,000, and the faculty increased by 44 percent. The campus added more than 4 million square feet devoted to classrooms, labs, offices and performance halls.
The Mondavi Center is one of the most visible products of Vanderhoef's tenure as chancellor. When he first took the job, he said the university needed a high-quality performance center and a greater emphasis on humanities and the arts.
For the most part, he said, he has achieved that. But one piece of Vanderhoef's vision has not yet been realized  a new campus art museum to display the university's collection of paintings and sculptures by Wayne Thiebaud, Robert Arneson and other prominent artists who taught at the school.
"I would have really liked it if we got that completed," Vanderhoef said. "But there's always going to be something waiting to be done."
Vanderhoef said he was proud of the expansion of the UC Davis Medical Center complex in Sacramento, saying the university had transformed it from an overcrowded county hospital to "something big and wonderful."
Last year, UC Davis received $100 million from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to create a nursing school at the med center. It was the biggest donation to nursing education in the nation.
Jerold Theis, a professor in the school of medicine, said Vanderhoef didn't deserve credit for the university's accomplishments.
"I'm not sure he's contributed anything significant to the campus' success," he said.
Theis organized a "no confidence" vote by the faculty in 2006; however, 70 percent of the faculty expressed confidence in Vanderhoef.
The vote followed a deal the chancellor struck with Celeste Rose, a former vice chancellor who had alleged that the university administration discriminated against her in pressuring her to resign.
In exchange for dropping her racial- and gender-discrimination claim, the university offered Rose a $205,000 salary for two years  plus a $50,000 transition payment  but required no work from her.
The episode was a huge embarrassment for Vanderhoef and his administration, said medieval studies lecturer Kevin Roddy. But it won't be an enduring part of the chancellor's legacy, he said.
"The most important legacy is that he really believed in the campus community," Roddy said. "In the early '90s, when we had a terrible budget crisis, he kept us all together."
Mark Yudof, incoming president of the University of California system, said Vanderhoef helped pull the Davis campus to nationwide prominence.
"I have, from afar, watched the campus go from relative obscurity to the front ranks among the nation's research universities," Yudof said in a statement. "I am looking forward to working with him during his final year." About the writer: Call The Bee's Laurel Rosenhall, (916) 321-1083.

Sacramento City Councilman Robbie Waters fainted momentarily Wednesday evening at a fundraiser for Rancho Cordova City Councilman David Sander, who is running for the state Assembly.
Sander said Waters was leaning against the wall when he started to slump. A few friends tried to help him back up when he collapsed.
Sander, a medical scientist, elevated Waters' legs and Sander's wife, Margaret Parsons, a physician, started checking his pulse and breathing. They was prepared to perform CPR on Waters, but he came around. 
Sander said Waters was even making jokes with everybody, but was taken to Sutter General Hospital as a precaution.
Waters organized the event, which was attended by about 40 people, for Sander at the Sutter Club in downtown Sacramento.
"Robbie is a friend. He's a lion of Sacramento County Republican politics," Sander said. "He's going to be fine."

TITLE: Bull roundup snarls traffic on Highway 50


TEXT:


WEST SACRAMENTO  A brown bull on Highway 50 held up traffic in the eastbound lanes for about 35 minutes Tuesday evening, according to the California Highway Patrol.
Two right lanes were shut down as officers and the bull's owner tried to capture the animal, Sgt. Andy Hill said.
The bull fell onto the highway just west of Harbor Boulevard about 6:40 p.m. when a side gate of a cattle trailer accidentally opened. 
The owner was towing the trailer with about a half-dozen cattle at about 50 mph in the slow lane, Hill said.
"We made a corral out of two patrol cars, an ambulance and the cattle trailer," Hill said. Then the owner managed to rope the bull. Some motorists stopped to help.
"It was an unhappy bull," Hill said. "It never expected to be bumped out of a trailer on a highway at 50 mph. It took a bit of muscle power and rope to get it back to the trailer."
Hill said the bull suffered some bumps and scratches. No one was hurt, and no accidents were reported. The lanes were re-opened by 7:20 p.m.
"I never thought I would have to corral a cow on Highway 50 in West Sacramento," Hill said. "That was definitely a first for me."

TITLE: State will run out of cash by October, controller predicts


TEXT:


The State Controller's Office is confirming that California will run short of cash in October if no budget is enacted by Aug. 1.
Controller John Chiang sent his projections in a new letter Friday to legislative leaders. In it, Chiang said the state would burn through $2.5 billion in reserves and slip $2.8 billion into the red by October if the Legislature does not approve the governor's proposals.
Last month, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed filling the state's projected $15.2 billion deficit by borrowing against future state lottery revenues. He included a contingency plan to raise the sales tax by 1 percent if voters rejected the lottery idea. 
The Legislature has a June 15 deadline to pass a budget, but rarely makes the deadline.

TITLE: Judge backs e-bingo, play allowed to continue


TEXT:


Local charity halls will still be able to use e-bingo machines, as a result of a temporary injunction issued late Thursday by a federal judge.
Under order from the state attorney general's office, several bingo parlors had planned to have their slot-looking electronic bingo machines removed from their halls at 11:59 p.m. Thursday.
A handful of Sacramento County charity organizations have complained that they would be quickly put out of business without electronic bingo. 
One operator said that 80 percent of its revenue comes from the play of electronic bingo machines.
While the attorney general's office argues some e-bingo machines don't meet the legal definition of bingo, the group seeking the injunction -- including one manufacturer -- argues that they are legal and banning them would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The issue is scheduled to go back to court June 25.

TITLE: Medical students rate UCD high on ethics


TEXT:


SACRAMENTO  UC Davis Medical School has earned an "A" from a medical students' group for having one of the nation's best conflict-of-interest policies.
Only seven of the 105 medical schools nationwide that responded fully to the survey were given the top grade, and three of them were in California, the others being the at UC San Francisco and UC Los Angeles.
Stanford's medical school earned a B, as did UC Irvine's. 
The grades, handed out Tuesday by the American Medical Student Association, are meant to encourage medical decisions based on solid evidence, and discourage those based on pharmaceutical industry marketing.
Last summer, UC Davis expanded its ban against drug industry gifts, lunches and samples to prohibit freebies from any company that markets wares to the large health system.
The medical students' survey covered school policies on accepting gifts, sample drugs, and consulting or speaking fees, as well as on allowing company sales representatives on campus and disclosing financial ties.
"There is substantial evidence that marketing shapes physician prescribing habits," Dr. Brian Hurley, the student group's president, said in a prepared statement.

TITLE: Cancer survivors donate to Davis research for test


TEXT:


A group of ovarian cancer survivors, who scraped up money by holding wine tastings and a yarn and fabric sale, has given $14,000 to help UC Davis researchers develop a better diagnostic test.
The money is the most unusual  and most moving  funding that a team working on cancer biomarkers has ever received, said Dr. Gary Leiserowitz, chief of gynecologic oncology at UC Davis Medical Center.
"These women have poured their heart and soul into every little fundraising event that they could," said Leiserowitz, who added he was "awed" by the effort. 
While the donors started small, their gift is having a snowball effect.
It has already drawn a matching grant and the combined funds are being used to lay the groundwork for a federal grant application.
Leiserowitz and three colleagues have been probing unusual patterns in the sugars in cancer patients' blood. They think they've zeroed in on a sugar configuration that is closely tied to the presence of ovarian cancer.
Although that's a long, long way from a diagnostic test for the general population, it potentially could tell doctors which women with ovarian masses may have cancer and which may not, Leiserowitz said.
Now, he and his colleagues in the glycomics ovarian cancer research program plan to gather a few hundred blood samples to do preliminary testing that could bolster their application for a federal research grant.
The $14,000 gift from the Sacramento chapter of the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition  plus a matching donation from the UC Davis Cancer Center  will make those preliminary tests possible, he said.
Members of the coalition, who "worked our tails off" to raise the money, know that "in research terms, it's nothing, just a pittance," said Kay Kane, a Sacramento chapter member.
"But it's seed money for something that might lead to a bigger grant."
The group chose UC Davis researchers partly because it wanted its donation to stay in the community and because many of its members are treated there.
"We wanted in some ways to give back," said chapter President Gina Dayton.
People interested in donating a blood sample to the glycomics ovarian cancer research program can call Leiserowitz's office at (916) 734-6938.
Researchers are seeking samples from women with ovarian cancer, women with suspicious ovarian masses who are going to get surgery and healthy women 21 or older. About the writer: Call The Bee's Carrie Peyton Dahlberg, (916) 321-1086.

TITLE: Trial in shaken-baby case will continue, judge rules


TEXT:


The trial for a nanny accused of shaking a Roseville baby and causing fatal brain injuries will continue, an angry judge decided Wednesday.
The source of Placer Superior Court Judge Colleen Nichols' anger was a campaign letter signed by the baby's mother that was in a congressional candidate's campaign mailer.
Mary Beth Acton, the lawyer for Veronica Martinez Salcedo, said in a written motion to the court Monday that the letter essentially convicted her client before the trial has been completed. Acton said the letter from Lorena Juceam amounted to "jury tampering" because jurors in Martinez Salcedo's current trial may have received the campaign literature from Doug Ose, who was running for the 4th Congressional District seat. 
When court resumed Wednesday at 8:45 a.m., Nichols individually questioned each of the 12 jurors and the five alternates.
More than an hour later she re-entered the courtroom and said that, though she was unhappy about the letter, she was satisfied jurors had not been tainted by it.
Martinez Salcedo is in her second trial on a charge of assault on a child causing death. Prosecutors allege she shook 16-month-old Hannah Rose Juceam so violently on May 11, 2006, that it caused fatal brain injuries. Acton said her client shook the baby only lightly and that Hannah may have had an illness or the injuries may have occurred at the hands of others before the day on which Martinez Salcedo was watching the child.
The current trial is in its second month. A first trial last year ended in a mistrial when jurors deadlocked at 10-2 in favor of conviction.

TITLE: Assembly OKs paid sick leave for all


TEXT:


California would become the first state to require paid sick leave for every worker under legislation passed Wednesday by the Assembly.
The measure would allow the sick leave to be used for a personal illness, to care for a sick family member, or to recover from domestic violence or sexual assault.
Assemblywoman Fiona Ma, D-San Francisco, said her Assembly Bill 2716 would protect more than 5 million Californians  about a third of the work force  who are forced to choose between working while sick or losing pay. 
"(It's) a win-win for workers and employers alike and is an important part of maintaining a healthy economy here in California," Ma said.
When employers offer paid sick days, employee morale is better, turnover is less, and health care costs decrease, Ma said.
The Assembly approved the bill, 43-25, with no Republican support. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has taken no position on the legislation, which now goes to the Senate.
Opponents said AB 2716 would impose a one-size-fits-all mandate that many small businesses simply could not afford.
"It's an anti-business mentality," said Assemblyman Bill Maze, R-Visalia.
Assemblyman Tom Berryhill, R-Modesto, said the bill targets small businesses that are the "backbone of the economy."
"The message it sends is that the liberal side of the aisle continues to do job-killing bills that drive jobs out of California," Berryhill said.
Under AB 2716, businesses of 10 employees or more would be required to provide up to nine days of sick leave per year. Smaller firms would provide up to five days.
The California Labor Federation and California Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now were sponsors of the bill.
Full-time and part-time workers would earn one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked. The benefit could be used after 90 days of employment.
If signed into law, the requirement would be overseen by the Department of Industrial Relations, whose costs would be about $600,000 annually, according to the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The measure also could be enforced through civil lawsuits.
San Francisco and Washington, D.C., have passed mandatory sick leave legislation, but no states have done so, Ma said.
The California Chamber of Commerce, in a letter of opposition, noted that many employers voluntarily offer paid sick leave.
But AB 2716 could hurt businesses that lack the money or expertise to expand their record-keeping and payroll reporting, the chamber said.
"In an already troubled economy, California should be seeking ways to stimulate job growth and avoid forcing costly mandates on employers," the group wrote.
Assemblyman Roger Niello, R-Fair Oaks, said that his family's auto dealerships offer paid sick leave but that he opposes dictating every other business do so, too.
In priority order, most employees want strong wages first, then health care benefits, then perhaps a retirement plan and vacation days before paid sick leave, Niello said.
"What we're going to do is impose (sick leave) on businesses that simply can't afford to provide everything," Niello said.
Businesses face lost productivity and potential overtime costs when employees don't report to work, he said.
But Assemblyman Mark Leno, a San Francisco Democrat who owns a small sign-making business, countered that illness is an unfortunate fact of life and that it is not necessarily productive to force sick employees to report to work.
"Clearly, business never likes to be told or regulated by government whatsoever. But this bill, I think, can actually benefit employers because you'll have a healthier, more productive work force," Leno said. About the writer: Call Jim Sanders, Bee Capitol Bureau, (916) 326-5538.

TITLE: Cousin of man shot to death in Foothill Farms arrested


TEXT:


The cousin of a man who was shot to death in a car Friday has been booked on suspicion of murder, the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department has reported.
Sgt. Tim Curran said Carlos Ojeda, 26, was arrested early Saturday following an investigation by detectives.
Ojeda had told officers that he was riding in a car with his cousin when someone walked toward them on Dream Court and fired shots into the vehicle, fatally wounding Javier Juarez Cerna, 26, of Sacramento. 
Cerna was found slumped over in the car, which had crashed into a parked car near Elkhorn Boulevard and Roseville Road at about 9 p.m.
The Sacramento County Coroner's Office reported that Cerna was struck in the head and neck by the gunfire.
Curran said homicide detectives interviewed Ojeda and determined that he was the person who actually fired the shots. A motive has yet to be established, he said.
Ojeda is being held without bail in the Sacramento County jail without bail. He is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Sacramento Superior Court.

TITLE: State to revoke license of farm labor contractor


TEXT:


The company that hired a 17-year-old farmworker who died after working in the fields east of Stockton is being stripped of its farm labor contracting license.
On Wednesday, California Labor Commissioner Angela Bradstreet began the 30- to 90-day process of revoking the license of Maria De Los Angeles Colunga, who operates Merced Farm Labor out of Atwater.
The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration is also investigating Merced Farm Labor in connection with the death of Maria Isabel Vasquez Jimenez on May 16. She had collapsed two days earlier after pruning vines for eight hours in the heat. 
Neither Maria De Los Angeles Colunga nor Merced Farm Labor representatives returned calls from The Bee on Wednesday.
The company will be able to appeal the removal of its license.
Paul Feist, assistant secretary of communications for the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, said the license revocation stems from troubles the company had two years ago.
The agency is revoking the license because Merced Farm Labor provided "false information" on its license application in September, he said, by not disclosing that it was cited in 2006 for failing to train employees how to avoid heat stress and other offenses.
He said Merced Farm Labor also never took care of those citations  either by appealing them or paying $2,250 in fines.
In a statement released Wednesday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said, "Employers or labor contractors who do not comply with the heat illness prevention standards will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."
Schwarzenegger and United Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriguez have condemned employers that violate regulations designed to protect workers. They also have said that Vasquez Jimenez's death was preventable.
On Wednesday, about 50 UFW members, relatives of Vasquez Jimenez and other supporters carried a black casket to the Capitol in honor of the young woman and other workers who have died from heat-related conditions. They began their pilgrimage Sunday in Lodi, where Vasquez Jimenez was living.
Also on Wednesday, a team of workplace inspectors from Cal-OSHA, the labor commissioner's office and other agencies found another Merced Farm Labor work site near Escalon in violation of state laws.
Feist said the company was providing shade and water for about a dozen workers tying grape vines. In violation of state law, however, the workers had been required to bring their own tools. The company also had not posted wage-and-hour rules or schedules of when workers could take breaks. Feist said his office will investigate further.
If Cal-OSHA finds that Merced Farm Labor willfully violated laws designed to protect workers from the heat in relation to Vasquez Jimenez's death, the company could face fines up to $25,000. Representatives of the company also could face criminal prosecution by either the local district attorney or the state attorney general.

Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef, who has led UC Davis for the last 14 years, announced Monday that he will step down next year. 
In June 2009, Vanderhoef will take a year-long sabbatical, then return to Davis as a professor of plant biology.
Under Vanderhoef's leadership, UC Davis expanded in several ways. Student enrollment grew from 22,000 to 30,000, and the size of the faculty increased 44 percent. 
The campus added more than 4 million square feet of classroom, lab, clinical, performance and office space. 
University of California officials said they will undertake a nationwide search to find a new chancellor for the Davis campus.

TITLE: Labor contractor in farmworker death case may lose license


TEXT:


The State Labor Commissioner's Office has begun proceedings to revoke the farm labor contractor license for Maria De Los Angeles Colunga, who operates Merced Farm Labor, a labor contracting company that employed a 17-year-old girl who collapsed in a hot field near Lodi last month and later died.
The action is based on allegations that Merced Farm Labor failed to correct previous worker safety violations and provided false information on the license application, state officials said.
The company was cited in 2006 for failing to provide employees with training to avoid heat stress, California Division of Occupational Safety and Health records show. 
Cal-OSHA also cited Merced Farm Labor contracting services in 2006 for not having an injury-prevention plan for its workers or enough toilets for them to use, agency spokesman Dean Fryer said last week.
Investigators from Cal-OSHA are looking into the circumstances of Maria Isabel Vasquez Jimenez's collapse and her subsequent death on May 16.
On Wednesday, a march led by the United Farm Workers in honor of Jimenez was scheduled to reach the Capitol steps.
Neither De Los Angeles Colunga nor representatives of Merced Farm Labor could be reached for comment.

TITLE: Flag tribute draws a challenge on Capitol Mall


TEXT:


Organizers of a flag tribute to the soldiers and civilians of the Iraq war had already battled City Hall for the right to use a public space. On Memorial Day, they were challenged on their willingness to share that space.
Usually lush green, the Capitol Mall lawn was transformed by 120,000 red and white flags to commemorate the death toll of the Iraq war. Each white flag represented five Iraqi deaths. Each red flag represented a fallen American.
Cres Vellucci with Veterans for Peace said volunteers started planting small red and white flags Saturday morning and finished by Sunday afternoon. The display was one of many salutes that took place Monday in the Sacramento region. 
Vellucci, a Vietnam veteran, said the display permit came through at the last minute with the help of a fellow veteran: City Councilman Ray Tretheway. The City Council overturned a decision to deny the permit after the American Civil Liberties Union of Sacramento and veterans appealed.
"It's a shame we had to work so hard for a permit," Vellucci said. "I'm still not sure if it was a political or bureaucratic thing."
On Monday morning, others wanted to make their own statements. Vietnam veteran Dennis Naguria, 58, of Elk Grove and his family added 232 American flags to the display's perimeter.
The unplanned addition was met with resistance from organizers, but both parties were able to compromise: Organizers would let Naguria keep his flags up throughout Memorial Day if he came back to remove them today.
The red and white flag display is scheduled to stand until Saturday.
Naguria, who brought his father, mother and two boys to Capitol Mall, said he spent about $100 on two sizes of American flags so he could honor fallen U.S. troops. He said he did not expect to get into a shouting match but believed the red and white flags were meant to spark anti-war sentiment.
"They belly-bumped me, knocked the camera out of my hand three times," Naguria said. "They said it's not a political statement. I'm sorry, this entire thing is a political statement."
Vellucci said organizers were only concerned about violating their city permit. He said the display was not partisan.
"People can take from it what they want," Vellucci said.
On the eastern end of the display, two pink Post-its with the names "Owen" and "Bo" were stuck on two red flags, symbolizing American troops lost. Others dropped off roses and hydrangeas.
Two of Naguria's American flags were turned upside down, usually reserved for a sign of distress.
Marine veteran Tom Hawkins, 52, and his wife and son questioned the appropriateness of the upside-down flags, but they decided whoever turned the banners had a right to do so.
"That's the beauty of this country," Hawkins said. "We allow freedom of speech. That's what men and women die for."
Samuel and Lucia Medina of Dixon happened upon the flag display as they toured downtown Sacramento. The Medinas stopped to read an explanation of the red and white flags spanning seven blocks leading up to the Capitol.
Samuel Medina, who said he doesn't have any relatives in the war, said: "It's so sad and hard to believe how many people died." About the writer: Call Judy Lin, Bee Capitol Bureau, (916) 321-1115.

TITLE: California appeals court looks at out-of-state inmate transfers


TEXT:


In a day of tough questions directed to both sides, the presiding appellate court justice saved his most stinging barb Tuesday for the lawyers representing the California Correctional Peace Officers Association.
The union is trying to block the state from transferring prisoners out of state, in part on grounds that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger erred in proclaiming a state of emergency to make the move.
Presiding Justice Arthur G. Scotland of the 3rd District Court of Appeal called it ironic that the CCPOA opposed the governor's proclamation, because its president, Mike Jimenez, told the Legislature two years ago that the state's overcrowded prisons put the system on the precipice of a "public safety disaster." 
"You've got a problem," Scotland told CCPOA lawyers during Tuesday's hearing, with Jimenez's August 2006 testimony and the union's subsequent filing of the lawsuit to block the transfers.
Scotland's comment came in a hearing on the state's appeal of a ruling by a Sacramento judge last year that found the transfer plan illegal and unconstitutional. It was illegal, the judge said, because it violated the letter of the state's Emergency Services Act. It was deemed unconstitutional because it undercut state employee job guarantees.
Schwarzenegger appealed the Feb. 20, 2007, ruling by Superior Court Judge Gail Ohanesian. The three-justice panel that heard the case Tuesday took the matter under submission and is expected to issue a ruling within 90 days.
CCPOA attorney Gregg Adam sought to play down the significance of Jimenez's comments. He said they were taken out of context from a legislative hearing two years ago.
"We've never pretended this is not an emergency of the gravest magnitude," Adam said. "All we've said is the governor can't invoke these special powers because the (Emergency Services) Act wasn't designed to utilize it."
Presiding Justice Scotland and Associate Justice Vance W. Raye battered both sides Tuesday with questions over the act's intent.
The justices wanted to know from the state's lawyers why they danced around the measure's literal language that defines an emergency as conditions of "extreme peril" that are "beyond the control" of city or county responders and require "the combined forces of a mutual aid region" to alleviate them.
"You sort of look at the language and then basically ignore it," Raye said. About the writer: Call Andy Furillo, Bee Capitol Bureau, (916) 321-1141.

TITLE: As Big Fix looms, the big uncertainty is how drivers will cope


TEXT:


Friday evening, as the last of the commuters exit downtown Sacramento, highway crews will swoop onto Interstate 5 with forklifts and trucks carting orange barrels and concrete barriers  equipment for an extraordinary event.
A mile of freeway in the heart of the metropolitan area will close. Drivers accustomed to unfettered freeway access will be asked to step aside. And, to the tune of jackhammers in the night, the freeway will be transformed into a $37 million, six-week, 24-hour construction zone. A leaky, crumbling roadbed will be replaced.
Planning is done, officials say. The countdown is on. 
"We're good to go," Caltrans spokesman Mark Dinger said.
Uncertainty hangs, however, over what will happen Monday morning when commuters return to downtown.
Will they approach with their old driving habits and turn Sacramento freeways into a congested crawl? Or will they heed weeks of warnings and alter their schedules or routes?
The answer may change day to day during what will be a complex project.
Over the weeks, construction crews will alternately close northbound and southbound lanes in the freeway's sunken "boat section." Closures will last up to two weeks at a time.
The first closure, at 8 p.m. Friday, involves northbound lanes. The first southbound-lanes closure is set for June 13. A second set of alternating closures will follow in late June. The most disruptive phase of the project is expected to conclude July 15.
"Our plan is to get in, get the work done, and get out ASAP," said state Caltrans director Will Kempton. "I'm excited."
Emboldened by its relatively painless three-day San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge repair last year, Caltrans hired the same construction company for the Big Fix, C.C. Myers of Rancho Cordova, known for its quick work.
Myers' crews are set. Workers will rip up the road, truck out debris, install a new drainage system to keep the Sacramento River from seeping onto the freeway, place rebar and pour new concrete. Much of the work will be simultaneous.
"It's like a big train," said the Myers company president, Dan Himick. "The work isn't complicated. The difference is we're just working around the clock."
Closing entire halves of the freeway is quicker and safer than working amid traffic with single-lane closures, Caltrans head Kempton said.
If this works well, he said, his agency will organize more projects in what state crews now call the "rapid rehab" way.
Caltrans has picked a busy crossroads to introduce the concept to Sacramento.
On a typical day, nearly 200,000 vehicles use I-5 through downtown, making it the most crowded mile of the freeway in California north of Los Angeles.
Caltrans officials have alerted trucking officials and briefed companies and organizations, encouraging employees to consider light rail, flexible work schedules, vacation days and working from home.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a proclamation last week urging state officials to help people get off the freeways.
Commuters should be testing alternatives now, Caltrans spokesman Dinger said.
"We're saying you need to have a plan A and even a plan B, and you need to try them out before Monday," Caltrans' Dinger said. "You don't want to be out there June 2 without a plan."
Highway officials have set up 66 message boards with a stark message: Expect major delays on all freeways.
Caltrans officials say it's possible congestion will not be nearly as bad as feared.
They point out that expected traffic nightmares never materialized last year when a key freeway ramp in Oakland was down for weeks after a gas tanker explosion and fire.
"We don't mind scaring people a little so they'll prepare for the worst," Dinger said. "If they do that, we can hope for the best."
Sacramento city transportation spokeswoman Linda Tucker and other officials say they hope the closures encourage drivers to permanently change habits, turning to transit, biking or carpools.
"We think Monday is going to be the worst day," Tucker said. "After that, people will find what will work best for them."
Many Sacramento commuters have been testing alternatives to their regular routes. Some complain that officials aren't providing any detailed detour ideas.
Caltrans officials say they aren't suggesting commuter detours because even they can't predict how traffic will flow once the closures begin.
They have offered two suggested alternate routes for through traffic, especially long-distance trucks. Those detours involve Interstate 80 in West Sacramento and Highway 113 between Woodland and Davis. A map of those routes is available on www.fixi5.com .
The Bee will publish daily maps showing which downtown I-5 ramps are open and closed.
A team of commuter-bloggers also will report on their experiences at sacbee.com.
Sacramento city officials, meanwhile, are pleading with commuters to stay on the freeways instead of bailing out into residential neighborhoods.
Residents of some close-in neighborhoods say they fear their streets could become scenes of madcap, cut-through traffic.
City officials said they do not plan to set up detours on surface streets, but will station police officers and traffic flaggers at hot spots, and repaint some lane lines and turn pockets.
Vulnerable surface streets include the P Street approach to I-5 during the afternoon exodus from downtown and Richards Boulevard both morning and evening.
Caltrans officials are warning people headed to Sacramento International Airport to carefully plan an alternate route and allot at least an extra hour of travel time if they are going during days the northbound lanes are closed. About the writer: Call The Bee's Tony Bizjak, (916) 321-1059.

TITLE: SMUD to present $300,000 rebate check to county


TEXT:


Talk about an eagerly anticipated rebate check.
The Sacramento County Board of Supervisors will accept a rebate check Tuesday for more than $300,000 from Sacramento Municipal Utilities District in connection to a county energy efficiency project.
The county is concluding the project at a number of buildings at its Branch Center complex off of Bradshaw Road, states a county news release. The project includes high-efficiency air-conditioning units and lighting and a 100 kilowatt solar panel array, which is large enough to power more than 20 homes. 
The project, which cost the county $3.5 million, is expected to save the county $360,000 in annual maintenance and operation costs.
Included in the money saved is $117,000 in annual energy costs, which also will reduce the county's carbon dioxide emissions by more than 800 metric tons each year - the equivalent of removing 170 cars from local roads annually.
County supervisors will receive the check from SMUD at 9:50 a.m.
Supervisors also will recognize public organizations and private businesses that helped make the project possible, including Siemens Building Technologies and SolarCity.

TITLE: Roseville high schools raise their sights


TEXT:


The public high schools serving Roseville have much to commend them: Strong course offerings. Healthy test scores. Well-equipped campuses where sports, music, theater and debate teams thrive.
Yet, in an effort both humble and far-reaching, the Roseville Joint Union High School District has decided a solid reputation is not enough.
Drawing from schools as far away as Fairfax County, Va., Roseville educators are on a mission to make their high schools not just good, but excellent. 
"We're looking at what great schools and successful schools are doing and bringing it back," said Tony Monetti, superintendent of the growing suburban system, which serves 9,000 students in grades nine through 12.
Among the efforts:
 Bringing International Baccalaureate programs to Oakmont and Granite Bay high schools this fall. It will mark the first time the prestigious global learning program is offered in Placer County.
 Creating a new collection of "common assessments" in key subjects. The goal is to go beyond the state's standards tests and make sure all students receive the same high-level academic content regardless of the school or teacher.
 Addressing head-on something many schools avoid mentioning in public: High numbers of freshmen earning D's and F's.
 Adding new Internet-based technologies often found on college campuses. District leaders hope to capitalize on teenagers' comfort with technology and expand their learning opportunities beyond the standard six- or seven-hour school day.
"24-7 learners" is the new catchphrase.
Existing budgets paying bill
In the world of public education, it is not unusual to find a district trying to improve. Often, such initiatives are driven by a blue-ribbon commission. Or a multimillion-dollar grant. Or a partnership with the private sector bearing a lofty name.
What sets the picture apart in Roseville is the absence of big names, big checks, or big-ticket agendas.
"It's not a packaged initiative," said Ron Severson, Roseville Joint Union's executive director of curriculum and instruction. He noted all enhancements are being made within existing budgets. "It's just a bunch of us working together. Principals. Teachers. Administrators. We're in our infancy with all this stuff."
The effort is already touching students.
Last Wednesday, for example, Jessica Rutledge, a sophomore at Oakmont High, experienced something she never had before: her English teacher instructing her personally in her home.
No, Daniel Flinn wasn't there in her dining room. He had used a new online program called "Blackboard" to record an electronic audio file for Rutledge. It contained his comments on a writing assignment she had turned in two days before.
Sitting at her laptop, Rutledge followed an electronic version of her paper as she listened to her teacher's husky voice. He complimented her writing triumphs, pointed out problems with capitalization, and told her that with revisions, she could bring her paper up to at least a B.
"Kinda cool," she said when the audio comments concluded.
"Who was that?" her brother asked from the living room.
"Mr. Flinn, my teacher."
Virginia district is model
The push toward greater excellence was born four years ago of a single goal, Severson said.
At the time, Severson was principal at Granite Bay High and researching how to start International Baccalaureate classes. The IB program puts students through college-level coursework under strict standards, and requires several years of planning and training to start.
Severson and other educators traveled to other schools that had both an IB program and a block schedule like that used in Roseville Joint Union. Under Roseville's "four-by-four" schedule, the day has four periods rather than the standard six. The periods run longer and enable kids to complete courses in just a semester. It means they can take eight courses in a year instead of six.
Among the schools the Roseville educators visited were three in Fairfax County, Va., a suburb of Washington, D.C. Continue reading on next page   About the writer: Call The Bee's Deb Kollars, (916) 321-1090.
Continued from previous page
They came away with far more than IB intelligence.
Fairfax public schools have a national reputation for excellence.
"Fairfax is at the top of the heap," said Daniel Duke, a professor of educational leadership at the University of Virginia who wrote "Education Empire," a book about Fairfax's successes. "It really is the model for future districts." 
Innovations taking hold
The Roseville educators were impressed by several strategies aimed at enhancing student learning, from teaching approaches to technology. They soon found themselves on a deeper journey: researching what the best schools in the nation were doing to educate their kids.
"We have good schools, but it turns out there is a whole layer above us," Severson said. "There are incredible things going on all over the country."
Over the past year, innovations have begun to take hold in Roseville's high schools. The goal is to prepare all students for college, or the workplace, which requires higher academic skills than in the past.
Many of the efforts are still in the design stages. The district is looking at everything from the way teachers teach and interact to the way they grade assignments.
This year, for the first time, the school board mapped out numeric goals to improve achievement. The board, for example, wants to reduce by 5 percent the number of students with D's and F's in freshman English, Algebra 1 and geometry. Currently, schools have 18 percent to 30 percent of students failing those critical classes.
"You don't get better until you acknowledge where you are," Severson said.
Technology key learning aid
One of the most visible changes has been technology.
At Oakmont, English teacher Flinn began using the Blackboard online system this year in numerous ways, from audio grading to online discussions about literature.
At Granite Bay, math teacher David Laughrea is using an interactive white board in his classroom. On the large touch screen, he works through algebra and trigonometry problems in class. After class, he uploads them to the Web for absent students and those needing further review.
"It's amazing. It helps me so much," said Julian Capili-Lewis, a sophomore in Laughrea's Integrated Math 1 course, which covers Algebra 1 and other concepts. Capili-Lewis said he failed the same course last year, and is doing better, thanks in part to the help of technology.
The high-tech additions are spreading gradually throughout classrooms, said Debbie Latteri, a teacher at Roseville's Independence High School who is helping coordinate training.
"It has blossomed," she said, noting that 175 of the district's 500 teachers are trained to use Blackboard. Those who monitor their students' usage have found many online as late as 9, 10 and 11 at night.
"They may be brain-dead at 7:30 in the morning, but they are fired up and learning at night," Severson said.
The efforts in Roseville have caught the eye of the Placer County Office of Education: "They have researched very thoroughly what's effective and they're acting on it," said Renee Regacho-Anaclerio, county associate superintendent.
Roseville's educators, she added, have been candid about their desire to improve and willing to share their experiences with other districts.   Return to previous page About the writer: Call The Bee's Deb Kollars, (916) 321-1090.

TITLE: As I-5  closures loom, jittery travelers plot alternate routes to airport


TEXT:


In Sacramento's River Park neighborhood, Ulla McDaniel has a case of the travel jitters. So do Loren Sanders of south Sacramento and Kathie Darnell in Placerville.
McDaniel needs to get to Sacramento International Airport on time Monday morning to fly to Copenhagen, Denmark. Sanders is headed to Indiana on Tuesday to visit his sister, and Darnell has a Wednesday flight to Los Angeles.
Starting Friday night, however, their main route to the airport will be blocked. Caltrans will close a short section of northbound Interstate 5 in downtown Sacramento for repairs. Intermittent closures on the freeway will last through July. 
For thousands of travelers, Sacramento's busy airport may suddenly be the hardest place in the region to get to, and at the worst time  at the start of the summer travel season.
The first few mornings next week, when McDaniel, Sanders and Darnell fly, will be the trickiest for airport-bound drivers.
All three are plotting detour routes. But no one, not airport or highway officials, can tell them exactly what the city's roads and highways will be like during the first commute mornings next week.
McDaniel, who has family and friends in Copenhagen, tested a route up Howe Avenue, out Arden Way, along the Garden Highway and onto Interstate 5 north of the closure area.
She has fingers crossed that traffic won't be bad Monday on her route.
"I have to make that flight!" she said. "If I had known they would start (freeway construction) that day, I wouldn't pick my flight that day."
The 76-year-old Sanders said he'll leave his home near Florin Road at 4 a.m. Tuesday for an 8:15 a.m. flight  just to be sure. He'll have his bags packed and sitting at the front door.
He decided to follow the main detour suggested by Caltrans and airport officials:
He'll go west on Highway 50 through Sacramento and into West Sacramento, where he will merge onto Interstate 80 (Reno direction), and then connect with I-5 (Redding direction) in Natomas.
"I guess I'd rather be there way ahead of time than miss my plane," he said.
Darnell, an American Airlines flight attendant, has to drive to the airport 10 times this month to catch a Southwest commuter flight to Los Angeles, where she's stationed.
She and her husband tested Caltrans' recommended detour Wednesday morning  the one Sanders plans to take  and reported happily from the airport.
"It was a breeze, a piece of cake!" she said. "Spread the word."
Caltrans officials warn, however, that the detour route could be crowded next week. The closures are expected to send congestion rippling through most of Sacramento's urban freeways, especially on Highway 50 approaching the I-5 interchange.
Caltrans officials have been telling airport travelers to add an hour to their usual airport travel time next week  even more if they're going during commute hours.
Airport officials say it's unlikely that airlines will hold any flights for stragglers.
"They should plan for their flights to depart at the time they are scheduled," the airport's Karen Doron said.
Airport officials are distributing brochures with a map of alternative routes and information about the closures. Caltrans also will post roadway message boards at the airport to give travelers some guidance.
But plenty of travelers say they are confused about what routes will work for them, and how long the drive will take.
Their confusion is compounded by the complicated closure plan.
Some weeks, I-5 northbound lanes will be closed, making it hard for many who live south of the American River to get to the airport.
Other weeks, it'll be the southbound lanes, which will make it hard for people arriving at the airport to get into downtown or to south and east Sacramento neighborhoods.
The closures will happen only on a short section of freeway in the heart of downtown, near Old Sacramento.
But the construction project has worried airport travelers even north of the river who, like Lisa Mangen of Roseville, won't be directly affected by the closures.
Mangen has to fly to Los Angeles next week, then back up to San Francisco for her daughter's university graduation ceremony.
She breathed a slight sigh of relief when told the freeway closures may slow her down, but that she won't have to search for a different route.
"I cannot miss that flight!" she said.
Caltrans officials said they know the closures will inconvenience commuters and airport travelers, but said they intend to work as fast as possible.
Sanders of south Sacramento said he is willing to tolerate construction closures, even though he realized this week that it's turned his trip into a travel oddity: He's allotted himself four hours for the few miles between home and takeoff, the same amount of time as his entire flight to Indiana.
"Now, that's something!" he said. About the writer: Call The Bee's Tony Bizjak, (916) 321-1059.

TITLE: Big Fix work tougher than expected, says C.C. Myers


TEXT:


Road builder C.C. Myers revealed Thursday that his crews have found repair work on Interstate 5 tougher than expected but said he still believes he can meet his first major reopening deadline of 5 a.m. Monday.
Myers' crews closed the northbound lanes of I-5 in downtown last Friday night to rip out and replace the concrete roadway on about three-fourths of a mile of freeway in the sunken "boat section."
Speaking publicly for the first time after a bout with tonsillitis and strep throat, the Rancho Cordova contractor said he is calling in extra crews from Nevada to keep the work on schedule. 
Myers said workers have had difficulty peeling the top 6 to 8 inches of concrete road surface from the base layer.
"The slabs are not releasing like we thought they would," he said. Myers said he discovered the two layers were bonded together during the original construction 50 years ago and that was not evident in the state's construction records.
But, he said, crews on the 24-hour-a-day project have gotten the hang of it and are now making good progress.
Wednesday night "was very good for us," he said. "If we can have that again tonight (Thursday), we're home."
Myers also called in what he called specialized equipment, cranes with plungers, to help break up the concrete.
By Thursday afternoon  with at times more than 100 workers on site  crews had ripped out most of three of the freeway's four lanes and had poured concrete on two of those lanes.
The 24-hour-cure concrete is already dry in one lane and is being used as a road surface for construction equipment.
"We're pretty confident we're going to make it," Myers said.
The construction schedule calls for reopening the northbound lanes before the Monday morning commute. The southbound lanes will then be closed the following Friday night for a 10-day period to replicate the removal and replacement process.
Myers said that gives crews a little extra time at the beginning of next week if the 5 a.m. Monday deadline is not made.
"It'll just be a little extra inconvenience," but he doesn't intend to miss that deadline, Myers said, adding: "That ain't our nature."
Myers has an earned an outsized reputation for quick freeway and bridge repairs under tough circumstances. Last year, his company fixed an Oakland freeway ramp in a matter of days after it had been destroyed by a tanker crash and fire. The company also installed a section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge over the Labor Day weekend while the bridge was closed for the weekend.
State Transportation Department official Ken Solak said state inspectors have been on site throughout the entire process and are maintaining quality control.
Caltrans officials also announced they will close most of the P Street ramp to southbound I-5 this weekend  tonight and Saturday and Sunday nights  to do painting on the freeway ramp wall. The ramp will be open during the day.
A single lane through to Highway 50 will remain fully open through the weekend on that ramp, officials said. About the writer: Call The Bee's Tony Bizjak, (916) 321-1059.

TITLE: Roof rises on housing's green future


TEXT:


Levi Benkert, the impossibly young visionary who runs the "eco-urban" development company LJ Urban, is probably smart enough and bold enough to do whatever he wants in business.
His track record indicates he could amass a fortune in real estate and retire with his wife and three kids on some island in the middle of nowhere.
In fact, his life was heading in that direction when Benkert slammed on the brakes, changed his focus and walked away from a real estate career that saw him earn more than $1 million in a year. 
These days, the fresh-faced and friendly Benkert, 26, wants to do something different with his time, money and land-holdings  he wants to change the world.
On Saturday, at an open house for the first completed vertical-style home built on a 1.62-acre site in West Sacramento, Benkert shared his vision of what's to come on this block and perhaps everywhere else in America.
This two-bedroom house, after all, is unlike practically anything else on the Sacramento market.
The prefabricated wooden stairs use 40 percent less lumber, the slats on the window shades are from trees cleared off the site. The kitchen has counters made from recycled paper compressed into granite-hard surfaces.
The windows are "thermally broken" to prevent energy loss. They even made the roof white to reflect heat. The air-conditioning system has a "night breeze" feature, drawing in cool air from outside when the Delta breeze blows. On and on it goes.
A smaller project in midtown called 9 on F  nine vertical homes on F Street  also emphasizes sustainable building materials, but Benkert says his company's West Sacramento 35-house effort goes even further.
Once considered a fringe concept embraced only by New Age hippies, green and sustainable homes may be going mainstream, inspired by a political climate that recently awarded Al Gore a Nobel Peace Prize.
LJ Urban is counting on homebuyers who want their dwellings to reflect their ideals.
Said one open house visitor, Matthew Tomas, 29: "I'm really happy with how they are reusing so many things, right down to the insulation from recycled newspapers."
"They really have a vision for a new style of development, which is a softer touch on the planet," said Craig Stradley, the Magavero Notestine Associates architect who designed the houses.
The open house was also unusual, and that doesn't even count vegan chef Kimba Kabaka serving meals in the single-car garage.
There were no price tags and no sales pitches for the development that Benkert and business partner Micah Baginski began calling the "Good" project. They see their role as educating the consumer, though the first five units will be offered for sale in June.
"These houses aren't for everybody," Benkert said. "We want you to buy this house because you believe in it. We'd rather you go somewhere else if you just want that screamin' deal."
The houses, spaced 39 inches apart, come in sizes XS, S and M, and will start in the mid-$300,000 range, with floor plans from 1,120 to 1,812 square feet. A sign out front stated, "Dream big, live small."
Benkert has been dreaming big for years. The son of missionaries and home-schooled for most of his life, he arrived in Sacramento as a teenager.
By then, his dad owned a business building rock-climbing walls. The company landed a lucrative job building the massive facility for Sacramento Pipeworks on 16th Street. Levi was the welder.
Coffee-lovers may remember a 19-year-old Benkert serving customers alongside his wife, Jessie, at Izzador's Coffee and Tea on N Street in midtown. According to a 2001 article in The Bee, the couple invested $30,000 in the business.
"We sold it and started doing real estate," Benkert said.
Then came the bold strokes. In 2002, he got his real estate license and quickly became a top producer with Lyon Real Estate. Benkert bought an $895,000 home in West Sacramento. It was 6,000 square feet on 5 acres. He got a mortgage without having to document his income and with little idea how he would make the $5,000 monthly payments.
He formed Asante Homes, divided his land into three lots and sold the house and property separately.
"It was very profitable," he said.
Then he quit, turning his back on a business model that was earning him upward of $1 million a year.
"I didn't like that we were adding to sprawl," he said. "I just couldn't stand to contribute to something I didn't believe in."
The turning point came when Benkert contacted pal Jason Presley, who was working at Pepperdine University.
"He was one of the smartest, most passionate, most creative people I knew. I hired him because of his genius. I told him to come take a couple of months and then tell me what your job is," Benkert said.
LJ Urban  the "LJ" is for Levi and Jason  was born. Presley lit a fire under urban idealists.
Investors were eager to get on board, too. Benkert says 30 financial backers have infused the company with $30 million.
As new as it was, LJ Urban became a leader in what Presley called the "eco-urban" way of life, with plans to build 250 homes in the urban core.
Not long after the first concrete slab was poured on the "Good" project, tragedy struck.
First Benkert's older brother, Jonah, committed suicide in late February. A month later, Presley was dead at 36  the victim of a liver disease.
Devastated, Benkert considered giving up on the company. One day, he went to a quiet spot along the American River and, he says, "I pieced everything together and said, 'OK, you have to keep going.'"
"He's absolutely a visionary," said Baginski, 33. "He grabs an idea and won't stop until everybody in the room is on board."
On Saturday, that idea had a front door, a staircase and a kitchen counter made of recycled paper. In the garage, there was a vegan chef. One visitor was marveling about the insulation made from old newspapers.
On the balcony, Benkert was telling a visitor about all that went into the house and all it stands for.
To say the least, it's a different way of selling homes. About the writer: Call The Bee's Blair Anthony Robertson, (916) 321-1099.

TITLE: Light rail construction will cause weekend detours at Watt


TEXT:


Construction of a new light rail bridge along Folsom Boulevard will require the closing of South Watt Avenue beginning Friday evening.
From 8 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday, the southbound lanes of South Watt Avenue will be closed between Folsom Boulevard and Manlove Road for work on the light rail bridge project.
The closure will not affect traffic on Folsom Boulevard or those going north on South Watt Avenue. Detours will be in place to guide South Watt motorists around the construction area. 
A new bridge is on track that will send light-rail train riders up and over busy Watt Avenue at Folsom Boulevard and allow traffic to flow underneath. The 539-foot light rail bridge will provide safety for motorists and train riders.
Close to Highway 50 and near one of the few crossings of the American River, the Watt Avenue and Folsom Boulevard intersection is heavily congested during commute times.
The heavy vehicle traffic is further stalled by light-rail trains, which arrive and depart at 15-minute intervals in each direction, and occasional freight trains.
The bridge also removes the possibility of a fatal collision between a light rail train and cars at the intersection.

TITLE: Trial ordered for Folsom woman in hit-and-run death


TEXT:


A Placer County judge ordered a Folsom woman to stand trial for the death last year of a 15-year-old Granite Bay girl who was struck while walking on the side of Auburn Folsom Road by a hit-and-run driver.
Superior Court Judge Larry D. Gaddis made the ruling Tuesday in the case of Anna Elvira Berset, 51, following a preliminary hearing.
Berset is charged with felony hit-and-run driving causing death and with a misdemeanor count of vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence. 
Gaddis set the trial for Sept. 15.
Courtney Parker, a Granite Bay High School student and former cheerleader, was killed in the June 13 incident.
California Highway Patrol Officer Mark Williams testified that Berset called June 14 to report she'd hit something on Auburn Folsom Road the previous night, but that it might have been a trash can or deer or perhaps a rock thrown at her by kids.
Officers went to her home, finding damage to the hood, headlight and windshield of her 2002 Toyota RAV4.
DNA from a spot on the vehicle matched Parker's, a state DNA analyst testified.
Prosecutor Jeff Wilson said Berset knew the consequences of a hit-and-run from her son's experience.
Wilson subpoenaed Berset's son, Joshua Sanguinetti, 30, of Colfax, who spent four years in prison for a fatal hit-and-run in 1999 on Auburn Folsom Road.
Sanguinetti testified that when he spoke to his mother June 14 she was "frantic" over having possibly struck a trash can or mail box. About the writer: Call The Bee's Art Campos, (916) 773-2825.

TITLE: Trio convicted in 2006 sexual assault of woman in Yolo County


TEXT:


Guilty verdicts have been returned against three men in the rape of a woman who accepted a ride after visiting bars in Davis.
Israel Sanchez, 23, of Fairfield and Alberto Sanchez, 21, of Dixon, were convicted on charges that included kidnapping and rape. The two, who are not related, face life terms in prison.
A third man, Edgar Radillo, 19, of Dixon, also was convicted of a variety of charges, including rape and assault. He faces 12 to 20 years in prison. 
The Yolo County District Attorney's office said the assault on the young woman occurred Aug. 12, 2006. The woman accepted a ride from the men but instead of driving her home they took her to a rural location in Yolo County where she was sexually assaulted and kicked in the head.
She was left at the scene, wearing nothing from the waist down. A passing police officer saw her and came to her aid.
A fourth young man in the car of the attackers, who did not participate in the assault, left a Dorritos chip bag at the scene. Fingerprints on the chip bag led to the identification of the suspects.
Also, DNA evidence later tied two of the men to the rape.
"These young men took advantage of a trusting young woman and brutally assaulted her and left her in the middle of nowhere," Yolo County prosecutor Carolyn Palumbo said in a news release. "She bravely testified against them and now they won't be able to harm anyone else."

TITLE: Israeli gift salutes South Lake Tahoe's revival after Angora fire


TEXT:


SOUTH LAKE TAHOE  Scarred and changed by a 3,100-acre wildfire, the people in this forest neighborhood found a sympathetic heart and a kindred spirit half a globe away Thursday.
The Consulate General of Israel in San Francisco and the Jewish National Fund offered 60 small Jeffrey pines  saplings to help repopulate the once lush mountainside where 256 homes were destroyed.
"What we saw here a year ago was a scene of pain," said Ismail Khaldi, a deputy consul general of Israel. 
On the windy, warm afternoon of June 24, 2007, an illegal campfire gusted out of control, raging for nine days among homes hidden among the trees and destroying almost four out of every 1,000 homes in El Dorado County.
Though hundreds of residents were displaced, none was injured.
To mark the upcoming first anniversary, Israeli representatives offered the young trees to symbolize their historic mission as caretakers of the land.
There is a connection between Israel  where environmental innovations long have helped revive the war-ravaged land  and the California mountain community, Khaldi said.
In a cul-de-sac ceremony overlooking the mountainside, Khaldi and others spoke as construction workers hammered and sawed, a nonstop chorus that struck up soon after the last flames died.
At least 70 of the homes have been rebuilt  most a tad bigger than before  and a handful of people have moved back already.
As Karen Martin, 53, sat listening to Khaldi, she held back tears, then swayed and smiled when she joined her choir to sing. She and her husband will rebuild their home beginning in July, she said.
After the fire, the couple searched other homes and considered selling the lot. "We just wanted it to unfold the way it was meant to be," she said.
A few months after the fire, they knew they would rebuild.
"Our land just kept calling to us," she said.
As she waited with other volunteers to sink one of the pine trees, she said she was ready to come home.
"This was our journey, for sure, and we walk it every day," Martin said.
The Jewish National Fund, founded in 1901, was created to purchase and build a Jewish state. The mission grew once Israel was established  60 years ago  to revitalize the land, including protecting the Sea of Galilee, the Middle East's largest environmental project.
The fund has planted more than 240 million trees, built more than 180 dams and created more than 1,000 parks in Israel.
The small trees in South Lake Tahoe were planted in a gully of county-owned land surrounded by once and future homes.
Ray Rodriguez couldn't believe his luck: The trees would be just outside his front door  when his house is rebuilt.
At his feet, a pint-sized Jeffrey pine sapling offered up a spiritual inspiration to him. His wife, who died a few years ago, was Jewish.
"I just feel her here," said Rodriguez, his arms spread as he glanced skyward, smiling broadly.
Behind him, bare land waited for the new home to replace the one he and his wife, Ida, built "nail by nail."
"Did she love the place," Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez, who two years ago married one of their close friends, tenderly patted the dirt around the new tree.
"Now, that's what I call a tree," he said, as gleeful as a child.
He asked to take home the plastic pot that had held the tree.
His current wife, Alberta, said her husband's family believed it was no coincidence that the Israelis stepped in.
"She is here," Ray Rodriguez said again of Ida. "She is here." About the writer: Call The Bee's M.S. Enkoji, (916) 321-1106.

TITLE: Children must wear life vests in county


TEXT:


SACRAMENTO  Children 12 and younger must now wear life vests before plunging into any river, lake or creek in Sacramento County.
The Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the ordinance Tuesday, prodded by a series of tragic drownings this spring.
Supervisor Roger Dickinson's original idea was to force anyone 17 and younger to wear vests, but the age was lowered during debate. 
Under the ordinance, which should go into effect Tuesday, parents would face a misdemeanor charge if their child swims without a life jacket. Because it is difficult to tell the difference between county and city waters, a companion proposal is being considered by the Sacramento City Council.

TITLE: Sheriff backs police finding of no criminal case in allegations against Johnson


TEXT:


A review by the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department concurs with city police findings that no criminal case can be made against mayoral candidate Kevin Johnson stemming from an allegation that he fondled a teenage girl last year.
Sheriff John McGinness told The Bee that his investigators reviewed the documents in the case and listened to recorded interviews, but that the girl herself declined to speak to them. Even so, he said, the evidence -- or lack of it -- was clear.
"We reached the same inescapable conclusion: There's no evidence of criminality," McGinness said. 
The case was opened in May 2007 after a Sacramento High School teacher filed a police report saying that a 17-year-old student had told him and three others that Johnson touched her inappropriately.
On Friday, Sacramento Police Chief Rick Braziel clarified the often-repeated police statement that the girl had recanted her original story. In fact, Braziel said, the girl's story and the teacher's version were similar -- but differed in interpretation.
"She said Johnson made her feel uncomfortable, but it did not reach the level of criminal behavior," according to Braziel.
Braziel said he called in the sheriff last week because he wanted an "independent set of eyes" after Councilman Rob Fong and Mayor Heather Fargo questioned the thoroughness of the police investigation. A police detective had spent one day on the case, reaching his conclusion after short interviews with the girl, her mother, and the teacher.
Fong and Fargo both said Friday that they would have no comment until the City Council receives Braziels full report on the matter, probably next week.
The sheriff said his department's review, requested a week ago by Braziel, was narrow.
"We did not gauge the thoroughness of the investigation -- in honesty, that's not our role," McGinness said.
It also did not address the handling of the allegation by Sacramento High School, where Johnson was serving as a principal at the time. Johnson's personal attorney and business partner had questioned the girl before police were called in. Fargo had specifically asked that the police look into whether that constituted witness tampering.
"My understanding is that there is an ongoing federal investigation looking into those issues, among other things," McGinness said.
The federal investigation was triggered by the school's failure to report the sexual misconduct allegations to AmeriCorps, which provided grant money to Johnson's Hood Corps youth volunteer program. Federal agents were in Sacramento again this week, continuing an expanded probe that is now looking at possible misuse of federal funds as well.
The sheriff's review also did not consider the relevance of a 1995 Phoenix case in which Johnson apparently made a $230,000 confidential settlement to a teenage girl, according to a draft of the settlement documents obtained by The Bee.
Braziel sent a report Friday to City Manager Ray Kerridge that contains the sheriff's review and a memo detailing the Police Department's initial investigation.
That investigation drew political fire during the contentious mayor's race. After Fargo and others argued that the police investigation should be reopened, in light of the information about the Phoenix settlement, Johnson's supporters countered that the mayor was using her office to further her campaign.
Braziel's department has declined to release the original police report, saying that would be a breach of city policy. About the writer: The Bee's Dorothy Korber can be reached at (916) 321-1061.

TITLE: Warning: watch out for bugs


TEXT:


Summer is almost here and with the arrival of warm weather comes the potential for West Nile virus.
California's Department of Public Health issued a warning this week urging people to protect themselves from the mosquito bites that transmit West Nile by appling insect repellent, wearing clothing that reveals less skin and draining stagnant water that attracts the pesky biters.
"While no predictions can be made about the severity of West Nile virus this season, Californians should take precautions," said Dr. Mark Horton, director of the California Department of Public Health. 
A bite from a West Nile-carrying mosquito can lead to fever, muscle weakness, disorientation, vision loss and paralyisis, although those severe symptoms usually only show up in people age 50 or older. Most people won't show any symptoms at all.

TITLE: Historic shutdown starts


TEXT:


Throughout the day Saturday, crews sliced up the thick concrete roadway of Interstate 5 in downtown Sacramento as part of the historic Big Fix freeway project that's expected to last for six weeks.
A mile stretch of northbound lanes was shut to traffic Friday night for the first of what will be a succession of closures to shelter crews as they repair the decaying roadway.
Crews also were power-washing the freeway walls in the sunken "boat section" area to prepare them for a decorative blue, green and yellow paint stain. 
"We're right on schedule," said Beth Ruyak, spokeswoman for the Rancho Cordova-based C.C. Myers Construction company. "It's going smoothly."
Or nearly:
Although traffic was reported generally light around Sacramento, construction workers alerted the California Highway Patrol Saturday morning of a four-vehicle rear-end collision on the freeway in the southbound lanes adjacent to the job site, tying up southbound traffic.
Caltrans officials said they also were disappointed to see some large commercial trucks cutting through downtown streets Saturday rather than following the designated freeway detour route.
For the next nine days, northbound traffic is being funneled at the closure into the right three lanes and forced to exit onto Q Street downtown or onto Highway 50.
The freeway was empty for only minutes Friday.
As the last cars passed, lime-vested crews from the Rancho Cordova-based C.C. Myers company assembled on the mottled pavement, unloading equipment, setting up construction lights and chalking the pavement for saw cuts.
Gawkers watched from freeway overpasses and news photographers scurried for views of the historic closure.
Chris and Cindy Huber of South Natomas watched excitedly from the Sutterville Road overpass.
"Anything that can come off this well, with all these government agencies involved, is quite impressive," Cindy Huber said. "Let's see what Monday brings."
More than 60 mobile message boards announced the closure on freeways from Stockton to Redding. Not all was smooth, however.
Weekend closure of the P Street onramp to southbound I-5 caught some unaware. Laura Trejo of south Sacramento was among the first to get caught up.
"I'm just trying to get home," Laura Trejo lamented Friday night after being turned away at the freeway entrance.
Work is scheduled to continue around the clock through next weekend. The northbound lanes will reopen for traffic - with a new surface - by 5 a.m. June 9, officials said.
Crews then will close southbound lanes for identical work. The freeway-closures portion of the $37 million project is expected to finish by July 15.
Caltrans has published a suggested detour for drivers seeking to reconnect with I-5 north of downtown: Head west on the Capital City Freeway, also Highway 50, into West Sacramento. Merge onto Interstate 80, Reno direction, and reconnect with I-5 in the Natomas area. About the writer: Call The Bee's Tony Bizjak, (916) 321-1059.

TITLE: Citrus Heights chase ends in neighborhood


TEXT:


With the help of a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter, officers chased three vehicle theft suspects through a Citrus Heights neighborhood west of Interstate 80 this afternoon.
The action was initiated about 2:45 p.m. by officers working with SACCATS -- the Sacramento County Auto Theft Suppression Task Force. They spotted a stolen 1994 Honda with three men inside going south on Mar Vista Way near Antelope Road. They followed the car a few blocks. When the men inside realized that the police were behind them, they all bailed out of the car near Blackthorne Way and Tupelo Drive.
"The suspects were jumping fences and running through backyards," said Citrus Heights police Sgt. Janet Schaefer. "We found one hiding in a garage." 
They arrested Brandon Christophe Butler, 20, who was identified as the driver. He was booked into Sacramento County Jail on multiple felony charges including suspicion of vehicle theft, and suspicion of possession of controlled substances. Jail records indicate that he has warrants out of Folsom for reckless driving, hit and run and violating a promise to appear in court. State corrections officials want him for parole violation.
Officers also arrested a 17-year-old boy, Schaefer said.

Matthew Berger's couching it in terms of him just campaigning for his wife ( Allahpundit read it the same way), but there was nothing in there to suggest that he was limiting it to just this primary. 
To be blunt about it, was this a threat?

TITLE: Obama might have lost his Hamas endorsement.


TEXT:

They didn't like Barry's AIPAC speech. By Mark Kilmer Posted in 2008 | AIPAC | Hamas | Obama — Comments (4) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
As predicted, Barack Obama's supporters are beginning to desert his campaign, Yeah, that would be nice, but I suppose he can do with these erstwhile Obama supporters :
In a statement following Obama's speech Wednesday to the pro-Israel group AIPAC, in which the Illinois senator called Israel's security "sacrosanct" and promised to support an "undivided" Jerusalem, a Hamas spokesman accused the Democrat of supporting the Israeli occupation.
"We consider the statements of Obama to be further evidence of the hostility of the American administration to Arabs and Muslims," said Sami Abu Zuhr, according to Reuters.
[ . . . ] âHamas does not differentiate between the two presidential candidates, Obama and McCain, because their policies regarding the Arab-Israel conflict are the same and are hostile to us, therefore we do have no preference and are not wishing for either of them to win,â Zuhri said.
Hamas had previously endorsed Obama on New York's WABC radio in April.
Read Onâ¦
Palestinian presidential advisor Saeb Erekat said his hangup was over Jerusalem. Barry said that a united Jerusalem should be the capital of Israel. (Politically, that's an easy one if you want to convince voters who favor Israeli existence and security that you're no longer one of the bad guys.)
This loss of an endorsement should not hurt Obama, as Hamas support might help primarily with Dem voters, who have already had their say in the divided Democratic Party nominating process. Hamas cannot donate to his campaign, what with their being a foreign terrorist organization
But please remember, Bob Malley, the former Obama advisor who also dallied with Hamas, is no longer technically with the Obama campaign, but as far as I know, Zbigniew Brzezinski is still there. Both Malley and Brzezinksi are "veterans" (loosely used term) of the [Clinton and] Carter Administrations respectively.
Susan Rice is still with Obama. She's the genius who suggested to then-nominee (Dem) Kerry that he ought to campaign on sending Jimmy Carter to the Mideast to broker peace, something which gave the Israelis as much pause as it did the dimwitted Dem candidate.
Obama's AIPAC speech has evidently convinced somebody from Hamas that Obama's no longer their guy, but with the account on Hamas being possibly closed on Barry, what of the others? I've not been able to find anything regarding the endorsements of Hezbollah or Islamic Jihad, which have never to my knowledge publicly endorsed Obama. Perhaps now they will not endorse him, sparing him having to repudiate his past in front of AIPAC.

TITLE: Barack Obama:  He'll Meet With Ahmadinejad, But Not With the Troops in Iraq


TEXT:

 By Erick Posted in 2008 | Ahmadinejad | Barack Obama | Iran | Iraq | John McCain | Political Stunts — Comments (53) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Barack Obama has not been to Iraq since 2006, when he took a *two day* tour. In fact, for all of Obama's alleged globe trotting, he has pretty much decided to form his foreign policy by reading the editorial page of the New York Times and listening to leftists in Hyde Park, instead of taking field trips to check out the scene for himself.
John McCain has invited Barack Obama to go to Iraq together. But no, Obama will not go. He'll gladly participate in a Townhall meeting with John McCain, but actually going to meet with the commanders in the field is too much.
As Jim Geraghty notes , Obama has rejected the offer calling it a "political stunt." Let's back up to the last paragraph: he'll join McCain in townhall meetings on the campaign trail, but doing so with the troops in Iraq is a political stunt.
The man who has said he would meet unconditionally with Ahmadinejad will not go meet with our soldiers in Iraq. And, as Jim says, that's fine if he thinks it's a political stunt and he does not want to go together. But Obama, thus far, *has chosen to not go at all.*
Even the media's narrative on Iraq has changed more than Obama's. The surge has had a positive impact. The media has acknowledged as much. Not only will Obama not acknowledge that, he'd rather close his eyes and not see the success.
And it's not just the troops in Iraq and General Petraeus that Obama is refusing to meet with. He won't even meet with soldiers from Illinois .
A lot of the left claims to support our soldiers, but not the war. Obama apparently cannot even muster support for our soldiers and sailors.
He's too busy planning his unconditional meetings with American enemies.

TITLE: The Answer:  FARC, Hugo Chavez and Barack Obama


TEXT:

The question: Name a South American terrorist group, its state sponsor, and a foreign policy fool By Charles Bird Posted in Foreign Affairs — Comments (1) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
When FARC terrorist leader Raul Reyes was killed and his computer confiscated, Interpol was contacted to ascertain the authenticity of 40,000 files and 610 gigs worth of documents on the hard drive. Here's what The Economist says about it:
They represent only one side of a story, and most of their claims have yet to be independently corroborated. But Interpol has now concluded that the huge cache of e-mails and other documents recovered from the computers of RaÃºl Reyes, a senior leader of the FARC guerrillas killed in a Colombian bombing raid on his camp in Ecuador on March 1st, are authentic and undoctored. The documents throw new light on the inner workings of the FARC. And they raise some very pointed questions about the ties between Venezuela's leftist president, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, and a group considered to be terrorists by the United States and the European Union (EU). 
Batches of the documents have been seen by The Economist and several other publications. They appear to show that Mr ChÃ¡vez offered the FARC up to $300m, and talked of allocating the guerrillas an oil ration which they could sell for profit. They also suggest that Venezuelan army officers helped the FARC to obtain small arms, such as rocket-propelled grenades, and to set up meetings with arms dealers.
Venezuelan officials have dismissed the documents as fabrications. That was contradicted by Ronald Noble, Interpol's secretary-general, who announced in BogotÃ¡ on May 15th, after two months of study by a team of 64 foreign experts, that the computer files came from the FARC camp and had not been modified in any way. Mr ChÃ¡vez called this "ridiculous", questioning the impartiality of Mr Noble, who is American, and labelling him a "gringo policeman". However, in one indication of their accuracy, the documents provided information that in March guided police in Costa Rica to a house where they found $480,000 in cash, as an e-mail suggested.
More below the fold...
One other thing about this Marxist terrorist group, which is listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Under Colombian president Alvaro Uribe, FARC is getting decimated. Last week, a key commander surrendered to the Colombian government, and she called for the entire organization to surrender:
The commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombiaâs Force 47 told reporters in Bogota Monday â a day after surrendering â that "the solution is not through war. There must be dialogue."
Nelly Avila Moreno, 45, whose nom de guerre was Karina, said she and her longtime male companion made the decision jointly to abandon the FARC group, based in the jungle, at 5 a.m. Sunday.
She said pressure from Colombian soldiers had been key to their decision, and she called on her fellow rebels to follow her example.
"I invite them to change the sensibility that is among the guerrillas," she said, seated by her companion, who said nothing during the news conference.
A couple of days ago, the Colombian army announced that FARC leader Manuel "Sure Shot" Marulanda had died (though this requires additional confirmation). As Gateway Pundit noted , four FARC commanders have died or surrendered since last March.
Here're some other FARC facts:
â FARC has close ties to the German far left, according to captured computer files (via Hot Air ). â Democratic Congressman James McGovern from Massachusetts has had, at the very least, contacts with FARC representatives according to the Wall Street Journal : "The Reyes hard drive reveals an ardent effort to do business directly with the FARC by Congressman James McGovern (D., Mass.), a leading opponent of the free-trade deal. Mr. McGovern has been working with an American go-between, who has been offering the rebels help in undermining Colombia's elected and popular government." â Gateway Pundit has a running list of items on Reyes' computer.
Here is a running list of the infomation discovered by Colombian investigators on the FARC terror leader's computers:
-- FARC connections with Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa -- Records of $300 million offerings from Hugo Chavez -- Thank you notes from Hugo Chavez dating back to 1992 -- Uranium purchasing records -- Admit to killing the sister of former President Cesar Gaviria -- Admit to planting a 2003 car bomb killing 36 at a Bogota upper crust club -- Directions on how to make a Dirty Bomb -- Information that led to the discovery of 60 pounds of uranium -- Letter to Libya's Moammar Gadhafi asking for cash to buy surface-to-air missiles -- Meetings with "gringos" about Barack Obama -- Information on Russian illegal arms dealer Viktor Bout who was later captured -- FARC funding Correa's campaign -- Cuban links to FARC -- Links to US Democrats -- $480,000 of FARC cash in Costa Rican safe house -- $100,000 to President Correa's campaign for election -- Chavez attempts to buy arms for FARC through the Belarus regime -- FARC branches in 17 countries including Germany and Switzerland -- FARC terrorists expanded operations to 17 countries -- FARC terrorists expanded operations to Germany and Switzerland
So where does Barack Obama enter into the picture? First, like Hamas, FARC is agreeable to an Obama presidency. The following was in Raul Reyes' computer files:
The gringos called for a meeting with the minister to ask him to tell us they are interested in talking about several topics. They claim they new president in their country will be Obama and that these people are interested in their fellow citizens. Obama will support neither Plan Colombia nor the signature of the Free Trade Agreement. In this regard, we replied we are interested in relations with the governments that are on equal grounds and that in the case of the United States, a public statement voicing their interest in talking to the FARC is needed, given their eternal war against us. 
It would be interesting to know who the "gringos" are. It is a fact that Barack Obama is opposed to the Colombian free trade agreement. Regarding Hugo Chavez, here is how Obama responded in last July's debate:
QUESTION: In 1982, Anwar Sadat traveled to Israel, a trip that resulted in a peace agreement that has lasted ever since.
In the spirit of that type of bold leadership, would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?
COOPER: I should also point out that Stephen is in the crowd tonight.
Senator Obama?
OBAMA: I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration -- is ridiculous.
Barack Obama has not retracted this statement. In fact, last Thursday, in the spirit of last July's debate, Obama said this about Hugo Chavez and Raul Castro:
ON CASTRO/CHAVEZ:
I would be willing to initiate such talks with leaders of countries adversarial to the United States. There would be a lot of preparation. The first steps would not be to pre-judge all the items on the list. 
The freedom of the Cuban people would be my top goal with President Raul Castro. As well as the release of political prisoners, democracy and the freedom of religious worship.
One of the obvious high priorities in my talks with President Hugo Chavez would be the fermentation of anti-American sentiment in Latin America, his support of FARC in Colombia and other issues he would want to talk about. It is important to understand that ignoring these countries has not led to improved behavior on their part and it has not served our national security interests.
There needs to be a shift in foreign politics and return to traditional foreign politics that were supported by both Republicans and Democrats in the past.
It's pretty clear to me that Obama is in favor of "my talks with President Hugo Chavez" and was trying to say "without preconditions" short of actually saying it. Obama wants these direct presidential talks with Chavez regardless of the strong circumstantial evidence that Chavez is a sponsor and supporter of FARC. I don't remember the United States, back in the days of "traditional foreign politics", having direct presidential talks with terrorist sponsors. The following day (last Friday), speaking before the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami, Obama's tune changed :
Obama, speaking today at the Cuban American National Foundation luncheon in Miami, reiterated his goal of engaging in direct diplomacy with Cuba and immediately allowing Americans from the Caribbean Island unlimited remittances and family travel to Cuba. 
He also promised to punish any South American government that gives support to the Colombian rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, an indirect reference to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. 
"We will shine a light on any support for the FARC that comes from neighboring governments," he said. "This behavior must be exposed to international condemnation, regional isolation, and -- if need be -- strong sanctions. It must not stand."
Jake Tapper asks the pertinent question:
So he will meet with the leader of a country he simultaneously says should be isolated? Huh?
(Hat tip to Hot Air as well). On one day, Obama talked about "his [Chavez's] support of FARC in Colombia" as if it's a Known Fact, and on the next, Obama is calling for an investigation to see if Hugo Chavez is supporting FARC:
When I asked him what he would do about the estimated 37,000 Interpol-certified Colombian FARC guerrilla computer files that indicate an active support from Venezuelan President Hugo ChÃ¡vez and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa to the Colombian rebels, Obama went farther than the Bush administration.
"I think the Organization of American States and the international community should launch an immediate investigation into this situation. We have to hold Venezuela accountable if, in fact , it is trying to ferment terrorist activities in other borders," he said.
" If Venezuela has violated those rules," he said, "we should mobilize all the countries to sanction Venezuela and let them know that that's not acceptable behavior."
"If" ? Just one day earlier, Obama said he would talk to Chavez about his support of FARC, as if the conclusion was foregone. Obama may be a quick study, but his policies on Colombia and Venezuela are incoherent, and he still hasn't backed down from his statement that he would meet with leaders of adversarial nations in his first year without preconditions. This is foreign policy foolishness, and it doesn't matter if it's Iran or South America.
The issue isn't whether or not an Obama administration talks to nations we don't like. McCain has also said that the United States would keep communications lines open with said nations at the appropriate levels . The issue is what Obama would say when he shows up on their doorsteps. There's plenty of talk about process , but next to nothing about what he would do or say. For Colombia, Obama should be opening the doors to increased trade and rewarding Uribe for the major strides made. So far, he's against both. Venezuela is a trickier situation, and it'll take someone with foreign policy experience to wade through those waters. The half-term freshman Senator clearly lacks in this department and--as Dan McLaughlin has pointed out --lacks in several other departments as well.

TITLE: Barack Obama supported the energy policy before he didn't


TEXT:

 By Erick Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Energy | John McCain | Obamafiles — Comments (13) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Barack Obama today in South Dakota suggests the United States does not have a good energy policy. He says "they don't have an energy policy that would actually weaken Iran and take money out of their pockets." I assume by "they" he means the GOP. He goes on to say we need to stop our dependence on foreign oil.
Well, I would point out that Barack Obama voted in favor of the present energy policy when it was put to a vote on June 28, 2005 â the very energy policy he does not now like.
John McCain voted against that energy policy.
I await Barack Obama's backpedaling on this. Every time he stands on the little record he does have, it's something he realizes he has to disown.
It's like the Democrats have nominated the love child of Michael Dukakis and John Kerry and then declared George McGovern his god-father (or is that gaia-mother in the Democrat party).

TITLE: No-Go Areas for Christians


TEXT:

 By Erick Posted in Liberals — Comments (9) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
It is no secret that the left models its designs for government on Europe. Political correctness, multiculturalism, high tolerance of alternative lifestyles coupled with high intolerance of mainstream culture, etc. â all are part of their grand vision. 
Well, witness the repercussions of these decisions .Mr Abraham said: "I couldn't believe this was happening in Britain. The Bishop of Rochester was criticised by the Church of England recently when he said there were no-go areas in Britain but he was right; there are certainly no-go areas for Christians who want to share the gospel." â¦. 
"[The police officer] said we were in a Muslim area and were not allowed to spread our Christian message. He said we were committing a hate crime by telling the youths to leave Islam and said that he was going to take us to the police station."
You may think this is an extreme example. You would be wrong. More and more this is becoming commonplace throughout Europe.
The United States remains the last best hope for the west. And people like your typical Obama supporter recognize that and are hell bent on making sure we fall to European style sensibilities.

TITLE: A few words on Puerto Rico


TEXT:

It matters By Ben Domenech Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Hillary Clinton | Puerto Rico | The Best Democratic Primary EVER — Comments (23) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
First off, a confession: yes, that was my cousin Hillary just thanked from the podium. I trust he is as ashamed of my political preferences as I of him, but we're nice about it and can drink together anyway. This is family, people.
Second off: who were all these self-styled experts about Puerto Rican politics who emerged over the past few weeks? I can't tell you how many glaring factually vacant idiocies I saw in ink form and online over the past few weeks, all because someone has a Puerto Rican friend or vacationed on the island a few times. Look: just because you've been to a place doesn't mean you understand its politics.
The rest of the RS editors always dog on me for linking to this publication, but I still persist in reading it, because I like it (and I like NPR - sue me), which led me to ask: Who the heck is Michael Sean Winters , and why is he so wrong about Puerto Rico? I'd assume a Jesuit to at least know enough to realize that the selection of Presidente over Medalla is not going to decide an election (look, I love PR, but Medalla tastes like it's aged in sweaty socks). But then, he got the King Canute reference wrong too , so whaddaya expect.
In any case, the third and most important point is this: Puerto Rico may not matter at the moment, or in the big scheme of things, but it should to any Democrat. It should because it shows once again that, given the opportunity to ice this nomination for good, Barack Obama cannot deliver. His ground efforts are simply not up to snuff for a general election, and it will need a vast overhaul to compete with a Republican machine that, for all its faults, still is at the top of the game when it comes to microtargeting voters and moving people on election day.

No, not quite a metaphor for the Obama campaign. By Moe Lane Posted in Al Qaeda | Barack Obama | Iraq | Pakistan | War — Comments (0) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Yet. But the Senator's going to have to address the details of this TNR piece (via Glenn Reynolds ) on the way that Al Qaeda's name is rapidly taking on the characteristics of mud among the very groups and cultures that they were hoping to impress with 9/11. Particularly since, as a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , Senator Obama is theoretically in a perfect position to either confirm or deny the arguments made by TNR. Although that doesn't explain why he hasn't talked about it before now: well, one more thing for him to clear up.
Senator Obama is welcome to take his time, of course. Every day that he sticks to his current narrative that the war is lost, and we must flee is one more day where he becomes ever more inextricably attached to that narrative - for good, or for ill. Probably ill, in his case... given that reality is showing a distressing tendency to not care about Senator Obama's election prospects . None the less, he can still get out of this.
All Senator Obama has to do is go on the air and admit that he was wrong.

TITLE: "That's Right. Fight Amongst Yourselves." (The Bill Clinton Edition)


TEXT:

 By Pejman Yousefzadeh Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Bill Clinton | The Best Democratic Primary EVER — Comments (0) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
The former President is quite the partisan for his wife's candidacy. That's understandable. What is less understandable--but perfectly delightful for Republicans--is that he is going around and saying that if Barack Obama makes it to the general election, he will lose :
Former President Bill Clinton said that Democrats were more likely to lose in November if his wife Hillary Clinton is not the party's presidential nominee, and suggested some people were trying to "cover this up" and "push and pressure and bully" superdelegates to make up their minds prematurely. 
 "I can't believe it. It is just frantic the way they are trying to push and pressure and bully all these superdelegates to come out," he said at a South Dakota campaign stop Sunday, in remarks first reported by ABC News. "'Oh, this is so terrible: The people they want her. Oh, this is so terrible: She is winning the general election, and he is not. Oh my goodness, we have to cover this up.'" 
 The former president added that his wife had not been given the respect she deserved as a legitimate presidential candidate. "She is winning the general election today and he is not, according to all the evidence," he said. "And I have never seen anything like it. I have never seen a candidate treated so disrespectfully just for running." 
 "Her only position was, `Look, if I lose I'll be a good team player. We will all try to win -- but let's let everybody vote, and count every vote,'" he said. 
 The former president suggested that if the New York senator ended the primary season with an edge in the popular vote, it would be a significant development. "If you vote for her and she does well in Montana and she does well in Puerto Rico, when this is over she will be ahead in the popular vote," said Clinton. 
 "And they're trying to get her to cry uncle before the Democratic Party has to decide what to do in Florida and Michigan" - which the party would need to do "unless we want to lose the election."
 He went on to say that Hillary Clinton holds an advantage in the Electoral College and that the press was not reporting on the issue--all of which indicates that the Clintons are more than willing to go down swinging and that they are perfectly prepared to wreck the Democratic party if they are not allowed to lead it in the fall election. 
 This is bitterness, of course. But it is bitterness with a purpose. Working class Democrats who have been averse to Obama's candidacy may find in these comments an excuse to sit on their hands come election time in the fall. Make no mistake: Bill Clinton knows exactly what he is doing when he makes these statements.

You should :
The mystery man behind the looting of a Bronx charity to finance the startup of liberal radio network Air America was arrested yesterday in Guam. 
 Evan Montvel-Cohen was picked up by border-patrol officers at Guam International Airport on an outstanding warrant from Hawaii. He had been indicted there last month for money laundering and the theft of more than $60,000 from a Honolulu landscaping firm, prosecutors said. 
 [. . .] 
 It was Montvel-Cohen who, as development director for Gloria Wise, convinced other club officials in 2003 and 2004 to give $875,000 of taxpayer money to the radio network where he was a top executive and co-founder. 
 He also received loans from the club of more than $45,000 that were never repaid. 
 Montvel-Cohen, 43, was never charged here, but two other directors at Gloria Wise pleaded guilty to misappropriating $1.2 million, some of which was used for personal expenses for club officials, including cars and home renovations.
 Key passage:
The $875,000 was repaid by Air America only after DOI launched a wide-ranging probe into the transfer of city and state funds meant to help children and the elderly in the northeast Bronx.

TITLE: Let's Beat Up On Scott McLellan Some More


TEXT:

 By Pejman Yousefzadeh Posted in Douglas Feith's Much Better Book | Miscellanea | Political Opportunism | Scott McClellan — Comments (10) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Because, Heaven knows, he keeps giving us reason to :
Scott McClellan's most explosive charges about the Iraq war are based not on any new evidence but rather on his reading of books and magazine articles after leaving the White House and on a period of "reflection." 
 On morning talk shows this morning, Mr. McClellan repeated a statement from his book: that he charges President Bush with a misleading the country into war based on reading a book by reporter Bob Woodward. 
 Mr. McClellan said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that he realized Mr. Bush had in late 2001 made up his mind to invade Iraq "when the president did interviews with Bob Woodward for his book." 
 [. . .] 
 During the interview, the 40-year old former Bush administration press secretary defended his portrait of Mr. Bush as "too stubborn to change and grow," but also admitted he should have voiced his doubts and questions about the march to war in 2002 and 2003.
There's more. Read on . . .
Mr. McClellan made no effort, however, to bolster the sourcing for the most serious charge in his book, that the president based the case for war on possible weapons of mass destruction only to hide his true motivation: the introduction of "coercive democracy" in the Middle East. 
 This charge has been given great authority because of Mr. McClellan's former status as a White House insider. 
 But a close reading of his book, "What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washingtons Culture of Corruption," shows that he reveals no new information about the presidents motives. 
 [. . .] 
 Reed Dickens, one of Mr. McClellans former deputies, said he found his former boss' book "pathetic in substance." 
 "He didn't have any damning evidence or quotes or conversation. I was flipping through the book, waiting to find something damning, and there wasn't really anything," Mr. Dickens said Friday night on "Larry King Live." 
 Dan Bartlett, the president's former counselor, has also repeatedly said on TV that there are no new facts presented in the book. 
 Conservative blogger Paul Mirengoff on Thursday noted that Mr. McClellan's book "is devoid of footnotes, endnotes, and supporting documentation." 
 Mr. Mirengoff, a Washington attorney who writes for the Powerline blog, says Mr. McClellan's book is a sharp contrast to former Pentagon official and war architect Douglas J. Feith's book "War and Decision: Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism." 
 Mr. Feith's book "provides detailed accounts of key meetings based on contemporaneous notes," wrote Mr. Mirengoff. "And it includes more than 30 pages of original source material plus almost 90 pages of endnotes. Readers can thus determine for themselves whether the author is providing a reliable account or merely settling scores and/or trying to make a buck."
 And here I thought that books are supposed to be original, interesting and that they should provide something new and fresh to the public discourse.

TITLE: John McCain's Sedona picnic


TEXT:

67 species of birds or a veepstakes? By Mark Kilmer Posted in 2008 | McCain | ranch | Veepstakes — Comments (9) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
John McCain invited several people to his ranch in Sedona, New Mexico Arizona, this weekend. There were old primary opponents like Mike Huckabee, Sam Brownback, and Mitt Romney. There were some prominent Republican governors, like Bobby Jindal and Charlie Crist. FedEx CEO Fred Smith was there. Lindsay Graham, of course, made it, as was Joe Lieberman. Former eBay boss Meg Whitman was there. And McCain advisor Charlie Black.
And there were others.
The nation's political press decided that this was a tryout for McCain's veep spot, while Lindsay Graham, appearing on CBS' Face the Nation , told host Bob Schieffer that his best Senate buddy was just showing off his ranch and its 67 species of birds. (NOTE: I here use "press" as a generic term for the media.)
There have been other recent get-togethers at the McCain ranch, including a recent one with Minnesota Tim Pawlenty, Mel Martinez, Trent Lott, and Utah Governor Jon Hunstman. (That was in early March, with little press coverage.) Martinez cannot be veep, as he was born in Cuba.
My two bits this Memorial Day, after my solemn embrace of the memory of those who gave everything to preserve our ongoing republican (small r) experiment, is that this McCain event strikes me as a cute sort of trick. We're not going to have any better idea of who is and who is not on the any list based on any guest list to a sleepover in late May. (I like Fred Smith, but he has a day job.)
I think Utah's Huntsman, a Mormon McCain supporter, would make a fine veep, but is he out of consideration because he was invited to the wrong meeting? (After all, he agrees with McCain, and most of the rest of the media-saturated nation, on AGW.)
I'd like to think, again, that this was a trick.
Read Onâ¦
Let us say that McCain's peeps wanted attention from the political press. Why not? It's been all-Barry, 24/7, for the past month. (Yeah, Hillary breaks in now and again with that monotonous, blood-curdling whine of hers.) An event like this will do it, and politicians with day jobs â Jindal, Crist, Brownback, Graham â will show up because McCain's the nominee of their party and that's just what one does for the nominee. Plus, how often does one have the opportunity to see so many species of birds?
Now, I included Lindsey Graham amongst those who "will show up [just] because McCain's the nominee of their party." That's not entirely accurate, as Lindsey has attached himself to Arizona's senior Senator almost since setting foot in the august body (plus Bobby Byrd). They've been inseparable. (I'd use the expression "mini-me," but it's both not entirely accurate and dated.)
By the bye, I do not want to select John McCain's veep. I do not know who it will be. Every one of the names listed by anyone is unacceptable to some group of Republicans; the GOP is not what it was in 1980, when Ronald Reagan could tab the nominating contests' runner-up, the squishy moderate George H.W. Bush. McCain's runner up was Mike Huckabee, and there would be some noisy dissent amongst some activists. In fact, every candidate who ran against McCain has three strikes against them going in, and not because they opposed McCain.
If John McCain were to invite me to a BBQ in Sedona, though, I'd play it up big time. I'd hold a press conference and say basically nothing in plenty of words, just to see the political press come up with some sort of conventional wisdom about nothing in plenty of words. I'd hire a publicist and queue for the cover of one of the weekly infotainment glossies like Newsweek or Time.
Yeah, this is fun while it lasts, but don't let it allow you to forget the sacrifices made to enable us to engage in our trifling banter. It may seem like a huge price for so little of merit, but freedom is never meaningless or inexpensive when there are those who'd like to lop off its head.

TITLE: The Free Trade Antediluvians


TEXT:

 By Pejman Yousefzadeh Posted in Barack Obama | Economic Ignorance | Economy | Free Trade | Hillary Clinton | Protectionism — Comments (0) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
James Surowiecki titles his piece on free trade "The Free Trade Paradox." I don't quite know what is paradoxical about it, since his piece makes clear that supporting free trade is a no-brainer and that as a consequence, we ought to be deeply concerned about the trade stances of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton:
All the acrimony in the primary race between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has disguised the fact that on most issues they're not too far apart. That's especially the case when it comes to free trade, which both Obama and Clinton have lambasted over the past few months. At times, the campaign has looked like a contest over who hates free trade more: Obama has argued that free-trade agreements like NAFTA are bought and paid for by special interests, while Clinton has emphasized the need to "stand up" to countries like China. Two weeks ago, both senators signed on as sponsors of a new bill that would effectively impose higher tariffs on China if it doesn't revalue its currency. The candidates are trying to win the favor of unions and blue-collar voters in states like Ohio and West Virginia, of course, but their positions also reflect a widespread belief that free trade with developing countries, and with China in particular, is a kind of scam perpetrated by the wealthy, who reap the benefits while ordinary Americans bear the cost. 
 It's an understandable view: how, after all, can it be a good thing for American workers to have to compete with people who get paid seventy cents an hour? As it happens, the negative effect of trade on American wages isn't that easy to document. The economist Paul Krugman, for instance, believes that the effect is significant, though in a recent academic paper he concluded that it was impossible to quantify. But it's safe to say that the main burden of trade-related job losses and wage declines has fallen on middle- and lower-income Americans. So standing up to China seems like a logical way to help ordinary Americans do better. But there's a problem with this approach: the very people who suffer most from free trade are often, paradoxically, among its biggest beneficiaries. 
 The reason for this is simple: free trade with poorer countries has a huge positive impact on the buying power of middle- and lower-income consumers--a much bigger impact than it does on the buying power of wealthier consumers. The less you make, the bigger the percentage of your spending that goes to manufactured goods--clothes, shoes, and the like--whose prices are often directly affected by free trade. The wealthier you are, the more you tend to spend on services--education, leisure, and so on--that are less subject to competition from abroad. In a recent paper on the effect of trade with China, the University of Chicago economists Christian Broda and John Romalis estimate that poor Americans devote around forty per cent more of their spending to "non-durable goods" than rich Americans do. That means that lower-income Americans get a much bigger benefit from the lower prices that trade with China has brought.
 Read it all. That the "reality-based community" should find itself on the wrong side when it comes to this issue should come as no surprise whatsoever. But it'll be a nasty shock to policymaking if the campaign rhetoric of the remaining Democratic Presidential candidates--and much of the Democratic party--actually gets codified as our national approach to trade issues.

So says a Democrat at today's meeting of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee. Watch the vid, H/T Marc Ambinder :Tasty quote: 
When you tell me that much bad news about someone, I start to panic. Suddenly it's no longer about being a Democrat. It's about being an American. It's about preserving the United States of America.
That's a Democrat speaking. But I am sure that the Democrats will argue that she's a racist.

TITLE: McCain's One-Term Pledge


TEXT:

The Promise that almost was and should come back By Ben Domenech Posted in 2008 | John McCain — Comments (61) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Marc Ambinder reports something that had been a rumor for a while as actual, real-live fact: last year, the McCain campaign seriously considered a pledge that if elected, McCain would only serve one term. 
McCain himself considered it all the way until the morning of the speech, then decided against it. But from Ambinder's telling, it doesn't sound like a firm smackdown to the idea.
Personally, I'm in favor of it. It's a suggestion Ramesh made forcefully last October, and I believe it would be a powerful moment of contrast between Sen. McCain and Sen. Obama. The negatives, as I see it, are as follows:
1. It reminds everyone that McCain is old, and Obama is young. Guess what: Everyone knows this already. Your HDTV will remind you again in the fall, trust me.
2. It's risky. Well, McCain thrives on risk. In fact, when he's not taking a risk, running an insurgent campaign, shifting paradigms, or running with scissors, he doesn't know what to do with himself, and we get that horrid immigration bill and a load of campaign debt.
3. If he's not running again, McCain will ignore the base. Look, this is going to happen anyway, on a lot of issues. It's been happening for years! All that will change is that McCain and the base can be more honest about disagreements, and fight things out old style, in the streets with knives.
4. It has some similarities to the negatives of resigning from the Senate to run for the Presidency. But unlike a Senate resignation, there's no farewell-tour quality to this announcement: instead, it's McCain putting all his chips on the table (insert other appropriate and terrible sports metaphor here). Why? Because he doesn't want to win to advance his power, he wants to win because America needs him. Etc., etc.
The benefits are many: it shows McCain as accepting his Churchill-like status on the right (we need you for this war, and when that's done, you can retire), it earns him respect once again as a politician unlike any other (imagine the interviews - the MSM gags on their spoons), it makes it more likely that angry pro-Hillary Democrats would consider voting for him (four years of McCain or eight of Barack? They can take four years of McCain), and it cements the idea that McCain views this as service, not personal advancement. It also has the added benefit, for conservatives, of setting up a far more clearcut primary battle for 2012.
I have no idea of any response that Obama can make that would seem good in response to an announcement like this from McCain. Suggestions are welcome in comments.

TITLE: California tolerance.


TEXT:

 By Paul J Cella Posted in California | Culture | gay marriage | Tolerance — Comments (4) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Suppose you are a government employee in California, authorized to conduct civil marriage ceremonies, and object on moral or religious grounds to same-sex marriage. According to the plain logic of the California Supreme Courtâs decision earlier this month, you are simply a bigot; the spring of your objection is irrational prejudice. There is no ground for tolerance for your views, precisely because your views impinge upon the fundamental rights of others. Recall that even someone (like Senator Obama) of the view that while marriage should remain an institution exclusive to a man and a woman, civil unions should be established for homosexuals, is also a narrow-minded bigot , again according to the force of the Courtâs logic.
 Fortunately, San Diego County is more magnanimous than the judicial despots of the Court. County employees will not be forced to perform marriage ceremonies to which they have a moral objection. Los Angeles County employees will not be so lucky . Tolerance forbids their objections. Wrote the City Attorney: âCounty clerks have no legal standing to grant county employees the authority or ability to choose which marriages they wish not to officiate at, based on their personal views or biases. [The Court] has been crystal clear on this issue â same-sex couples must be afforded equal protection under the law.â
 It is instructive to observe the machinations of Liberalism on this issue. It is not enough that approval of same-sex marriage be institutionalized in law; disapproval of its opponents, too, must be institutionalized in law. We cannot âagree to disagree,â in the common catchphrase. For a state employee to resist blessing same-sex unions is tantamount to his denial of equal protection to a certain class of people; in short, unconstitutional.
 Libertarians can hardly go a day without denouncing the âimpositionâ of morality by traditionalists; yet the imposition contemplated by Los Angeles County, in accordance with the Courtâs clear logic, eludes their attention. In this our dear Libertarians simply resemble Liberals in their quaint innocence of what a public orthodoxy is. To use their cherished parlance, never has there existed a society that did not impose morality. The imposition of morality is a concomitant of social order. No orthodoxy, no society. That Liberals and Libertarians are uncomfortable with words like âorthodoxyâ in no way changes the fact that they seek to impose one just like anyone else.
 In our country, no one imposes morality like supreme courts. We are at the point where it is possible to answer the question, Who rules America? with a single word: âCourts.â Perhaps someone among out Liberals and Libertarians would like to make a forthright argument for judicial aristocracy. That at least would have the virtue of candor.

why intelligence analysts shouldn't drive trains By streiff Posted in hayden | Intelligence | War — Comments (5) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »

[Note: I'm taking a short break from our daily Obamafest to check in on the rest of the world]
In most activities you have two basic choices to make, a former commander of mine was fond of saying. You can drive the train or you can call out the whistlestops. I naturally prefer driving the train but I can call whistlestops with the best of them. What I can't abide is the guy who claims to be driving the train calling the whistlestops or, conversely, the guy who is supposed to call the whistlestops trying to drive the train.
I'd submit that this basic inability to either decide on a role, or to carry out the role they are best suited for, is the crux of the problem with our intelligence apparatus. 
Read on.
Nearly a year ago I wrote this story taking to task a Marine lieutenant colonel who gained momentary fame, and if there is a Just God a lasting reputation as an asshat, for writing a crafted-for-leaking intelligence estimate declaring Iraq's Anbar province lost to the Coaltion. A report that appeared shortly before al Qaeda was driven from that province.
Today in the Washington Post we have another example. Headlined as U.S. Cites Big Gains Against Al Qaeda we learn:
Less than a year after his agency warned of new threats from a resurgent al-Qaeda, CIA Director Michael V. Hayden now portrays the terrorist movement as essentially defeated in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and on the defensive throughout much of the rest of the world, including in its presumed haven along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
Just a year ago, on May 20, 2007, the CIA was quoted as saying that the al Qaeda's success in the war in Iraq had created a fund raising bonanza for them:
The senior U.S. counterterrorism official said there are "lots of indications they can move people in and out easier," and that Iraq operatives often bring cash.
"A year ago we were saying they were having serious money problems," the official said. "That seems to have eased up."
The cash is mainly U.S. currency in relatively modest sums â tens of thousands of dollars. The scale of the payments suggests the money is not meant for funding elaborate terrorist plots, but for covering al-Qaida's day-to-day costs: paying off tribal leaders, hiring security and buying provisions.
Al-Qaida in Iraq has drawn increasingly large contributions from elsewhere in the Muslim world â largely because the fight against U.S. forces has mobilized Middle East donors, officials said.
"Success in Iraq and Afghanistan is the reason people are contributing again, with money and private contributions coming back in from the gulf," the senior U.S. counterterrorism official said.
He added that al-Qaida in Iraq also has become an effective criminal enterprise.
In September, Michael "Anonymous" Scheuer, former head of the CIA's faild bin Laden unit of the 1990s, remarked when commenting on a bin Laden video:
"First of all, the setting is very relaxed, very comfortable. He is not in his camouflaged jacket. There's no rifle. What he is trying to say is that he is under no pressure from the Americans. The Americans are failing in their effort to kill him, and in their effort to destroy al Qaeda.
[...]
He is gloating. They think they're winning, and I think they're probably correct at the moment."
But what has really changed in the past year? Nothing. The trends that Hayden relies upon for today's assessment were readily apparent to anyone paying attention for at least 18-24 months. In fact, just as the CIA was predicating al Qaeda's fundraising prowess on its success in Iraq al Qaeda had nearly been eradicated from western Iraq.
We see the same effect in pronouncements from last year that Iraqi prime minister al Maliki was nothing more than an Iranian stooge and a captive of al Sadr. Today, we see an al-Maliki firmly in control of his government and Sadr's Mahdi Army driven from Basra and no longer a visible force in Sadr City.
What has changed in the intervening time? Not much, really. The political strength that allowed al Maliki to launch the offensive against Sadr didn't happen overnight.
The problem in all cases is that our intelligence community seems to be contending for a role as Master of the Obvious but ignoring their obligation to tell us where trends are taking us. Or, going back to the train analogy, they are claiming they can drive the train but in reality they are only suited to calling out whistlestops. So long as this type of non-analytic analysis is used as the basis for developing national security policy we are all at risk.

Jake Tapper reports that Father Mike Pfleger again has spoken out attacking Hillary Clinton. But this time he threw John McCain in the mix: "Hillary and McCain would wish they had a preacher with the integrity of Jeremiah Wright. â¦ They got some old weak preacherâ¦some old Joel Osteen cotton candy preacher."
Listen to the audio of the sermon here . 
Earlier, Tapper had noted in a story about the local diocese rejection of Pfleger's that:
I just have to say, as someone of faith, I have never before heard a cleric engage in such disdainful mockery from a pulpit. Have you?

The RNC has put up a new website at www.meetbarackobama.com that will, no doubt, reveal to the world what a shallow, vapid, pseudo-communist Mr. Messiah Complex really is.
Naturally, the Obamanation has decided to hit up the front page poll on whether Obama has the experience to be President. Say what you will about Ron Paul and the Paultards, but at least they were/are supporting a guy who actually had a real legislative record of some duration.
Apparently, good speechifying is the only experience -- and maybe advising ACORN activists on subverting voter registration laws back in his law practice days.

TITLE: How Bad Will YOUR State be Hit with Lieberman-Warner Globaloney Bill?


TEXT:

 By Warner Todd Huston Posted in Congress — Comments (8) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
The Senate's most influential global warming bill is the Lieberman-Warner global climate change bill, a bill that claims to combat so-called global warming. Well, it won't do much for global warming (in fact, nothing man can do can either cause or stop climate change) but it WILL cost each and every person in the country more money in higher energy bills, lost productivity and jobs as well as higher regulatory costs. 
So, Illinois (Where I am from), let's say you have been bamboozled by this global warming hysteria. You say that you want Lieberman-Warner to pass so that we can "do something" about your mythical global catastrophe you are so sure is coming. Well, open up you wallets and pay up, because it's gonna cost you. 
Let's start with your energy costs. By 2025 the Lieberman-Warner bill will add $263 dollars a year top your electric costs. Natural gas prices will be artificially forced up $178 and gasoline an additional $324 dollars a year. Now this will be ON TOP of all the other price increases that will be naturally added to the costs of these products. (The costs are based on current prices) 
Worse will be the loss of jobs. By 2030 over 100,000 jobs will be lost to the state of Illinois because of Lieberman-Warner. Personal income will fall statewide by over 5 MILLION dollars. 
And this is just Illinois. 
There are similar numbers of the loss in every state n the Union. Some states take an even bigger hit than Illinois. 
So, if you want to "save the earth," expect to be living in grass huts because the so-called cure will send us all back to the dark ages. 
Be sure and Visit my Home blog Publius' Forum . It's what's happening NOW!

TITLE: Barack Obama's "Hillary" Problem


TEXT:

 By Pejman Yousefzadeh Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Hillary Clinton | It's Not Easy To Love Another — Comments (7) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Because of the very same crass, power-hungry behavior we have come to expect from the Clintons, Barack Obama is presented with a fair amount of trouble. Despite Hillary Clinton's endorsement of Obama in today's speech announcing the suspension of her campaign, some of Clinton's supporters are not quite yet willing to come on board :
Cynthia Ubaldo, 44, a Clinton supporter in Columbus, Ohio, just switched her registration from Democratic to independent and donated $10 to Mr. McCain. The endorsement on Saturday is a mandatory, empty gesture, Ms. Ubaldo said. 
 "I'm sure Hillary's cussing Obama out to Bill and Chelsea as we speak," she said. 
 [. . .] 
 If he does not offer the vice-presidential position to Mrs. Clinton, "I'm going to be really angry," said Alida Black, another longtime Clinton supporter. 
 "Hillary is not interchangeable," Ms. Black added, warning Mr. Obama not to select, say, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas as a gesture to please women. 
 [. . .] 
 For Ms. Ubaldo, the Clinton supporter who switched registration and donated to Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee is not so much a protest choice as an appealing alternative. 
 "This guy is not a conservative," said Ms. Ubaldo, who does not have health insurance but does have a subprime mortgage.
 I imagine that there are a fair amount of people like Ms. Ubaldo. Some of them are discussed here . They could have potentially transferred their loyalties long ago, but Hillary Clinton decided to drag out the campaign to the point that her supporters became quite embittered indeed. Oh sure, most of these people will go back to supporting Senator Obama. But some may not. And in a close election, that may make all of the difference in the world. 
 Barack Obama may have lots and lots of reasons to dislike Hillary Clinton at the end of all of this. She has done everything within her power to prevent Democrats from being able to come together earlier and united their party against John McCain. Maybe Obama can patch the party back together soon enough. But if he can't, and if more people like Ms. Ubaldo either sit on their hands or end up supporting John McCain, Obama will know who to thank.

TITLE: Haditha Update


TEXT:

one acquittal and unlawful command influence By streiff Posted in Haditha | War — Comments (11) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
I've covered the Haditha events fairly extensively since they first broke ( here | here | here ) including an interview with the the defense team of LTC Jeffrey Chessani.
As a career Army officer I have to admit that my faith in the military justice system has been both shaken and bolstered by what has happened thus far.
But first the news.
Read on.
The top story is that the first Marine to be court martialed in conjunction with the alleged massacre at Haditha was acquitted.
A military jury acquitted a Marine intelligence officer Wednesday of charges that he tried to help cover up the killings of 24 Iraqis.
Cheers erupted as the seven-officer panel cleared 1st Lt. Andrew Grayson, who was the first of three Marines to be tried in the biggest U.S. criminal case involving Iraqi deaths linked to the war. The verdict came just five hours after deliberations began.
This leaves two more Marines facing trial over the incident: LTC Jeffrey Chessani and SSG Frank Wuterich. Of the eight Marines originally charged in the incident six have now been exonerated.
From the beginning politics have played role exceeding that of the administration of justice. It is at least arguable, both Murtha and the LA Times having done so, that the source for Jack Murtha's characterization of the actions at Haditha as "cold blooded murder" was none other than Commandant of the Marine Corps .
The more this Orwellian nightmare persists the more it becomes apparent that these Marines have been offered up as a latter day human sacrifice to appease angry political gods.
For instance, witness the thin gruel charged against LT Grayson. He was charged with obstruction of justice for ordering the deletion of digital photos when regulations required their deletion of photos of dead Iraqis if they had no intelligence value and when he did not know that Haditha was under investigation. He was charged with improperly separating from the Marines even though he was advised by his military attorney and his commander that there was no reason he could not discharged.
The case against LTC Chessani has hit a snag which might very well result in the dismissal of all charges. The defense team alleged that unlawful command influence had permeated the case. The military judge agreed that there was sufficient evidence of such influence that he has directed a hearing on the matter.
[The military judge] Colonel [Steven] Folsom found that the defense met its burden of presenting âsome evidenceâ of actual and apparent unlawful command influence. His decision was based upon the evidence that the Generals who controlled the disposition of the case were apparently or actually impermissibly influenced by Marine lawyer Colonel John Ewers, who was permitted to attend numerous, closed-session meetings in which LtCol Chessaniâs case was discussed. 
Colonel Ewers was one of the investigators of the Haditha incident from the beginning. He is a witness that the prosecutors plan to call in its case against LtCol Chessani. Consequently, he should not have been involved in any of the meetings in which the disposition of the Haditha cases was discussed with the Generals who convened the court martial. During the hearing, the defense called Col Ewers as a witness. Col Ewers admitted that he was present during at least 25 meetings in which LtCol Chessaniâs case and the other Haditha cases were discussed with the Generals and other legal advisors.
This has led to the unprecedent action of a Marine four-star general being hauled into court to explain why his actions have not perverted the course of justice.
As I've written much earlier, I've no sympathy for war crimes. I don't think any soldier does. But at the same time young men -- and women -- on the sharp end of our nation's spear deserve much better that being second guessed at leisure by people who weren't there. And if they are going to be second guessed they deserve a chain of command who will at least give them a fair hearing.
Sadly, the Marines have failed in much of this. Arguably there is reason to bring SSG Wuterich to trial. He lead the rifle squad which did most of the fighting. LTC Chessani did nothing more or less than every officer in his chain of command. If he goes on trial his regimental and divisional commanders should be at the defendant's table with him.
Even as we're seeing that individual investigating officers, jurors, defense attorneys, and military judges are not willing to kowtow to political exigency, the next act is waiting to come on stage. When LTC Chessani and SSG Wuterich are eventually and rightfully exonerated, notwithstanding that their careers will have been ruined and their reputations permanently sullied, there will be a hue and cry to bring these allegations under the purview of federal grand juries and federal courts. A forum that would provide immediate gratification to any ambitious prosecutor and place the freedom of our men and women in uniform in the hands of people who cannot possibly understand the situation and who are quite possibly hostile to them in principle.

On that early morning of February 27, 1902 when former lieutenants of the Bushveldt Carabiniers, Harry Morant and Peter Handcock held hands and marched to their deaths at the hands of a firing squad from the Cameron Highlanders, they served, in the view of many senior British officers and diplomats, a useful function. Through their deaths they were helping to bring to an end the Second Boer War.
The Boer government was, after an extraordinarily brutal little war featuring concentration camps and summary executions, interested in gaining what it could through negotiations. The Kaiser, who had provided the Boers with Mauser rifles and Krupps field guns by way of its African colony, German Southwest Africa, was making noises about intervening on behalf of the Boers. The British, having lost 21,000 men, wanted to bring the war to a close.
Morant and Handcock had allegedly shot nine or so Boer prisoners and a German missionary. It was a two-fer. The British got to demonstrate to the Boers that they stood for fair play, justice for all and all that, and they got to mollify the Kaiser over the death of one of his subjects. All the threads came neatly together at a rifle range outside the fort at Pietersburg in Transvaal.
One doesnât have to look far to see the beginnings of a clamor to make some of our own troops a sacrifice for the sake of appeasing foes in Iraq and at home.
Read on.
Back in July CSISâs Anthony Cordesman wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post entitled The Price of Success In Iraq .
 Another price to be paid: It must be shown, by the Iraqi government, that it will separately investigate any charge against U.S. personnel in Iraq. The new government cannot claim to be free or sovereign while ignoring American abuses to date. We have made real mistakes, and a handful of soldiers have committed real crimes. The Iraqi people must see that their government will not ignore this or defer to us because of its dependence upon us. 
 At the same time, we need to understand that honest investigations of this kind will save American lives. Iraq is filled with false charges and conspiracy theories. Exaggerating or falsifying U.S. incidents and crimes is a key propaganda weapon for our enemies. Iraqi investigations that refute such charges, explain the necessities of battle, and show that U.S. and Iraqi forces are cooperating will defuse such charges and the anger and vengeance that follow.
 While I think we can all agree to the premise, I think we can all see the ultimate outcome. Eventually there will be instances in which Iraqi and US investigators will disagree on the findings, maybe in good faith and maybe not, and there will be a demand that US soldiers be tried before Iraqi courts. 
 The second line of attack is that military courts simply arenât tough enough. The idea that courts martial are easy tickets out of trouble will be news to anyone who served but then you wouldnât have read Homicide Charges Rare In Iraq War. Now there could be a very good reason for that. Like, for instance, there being very few homicides but it could just be the corrupt military machine protecting its own:
 Some military officials and analysts say the small numbers reflect the caution and professionalism exercised by U.S. forces on an urban battlefield where it is often difficult to distinguish combatants from civilians. Others argue the statistics illustrate commanders' reluctance to investigate and hold troops accountable when they take the lives of civilians. 
 "I think there are a number of cases that never make it to the reporting stage, and in some that do make it to the reporting stage, there has been a reluctance to pursue them vigorously," said Gary D. Solis, a law professor at Georgetown University and a former Marine prosecutor. "There have been fewer prosecutions in Iraq than one might expect." 
 â¦ 
 The homicide data have caused concern among some human rights advocates and experts on military law, who say the low conviction rate and seemingly lenient punishments may be sending the wrong signal, both to U.S. troops and to the Iraqi people. 
 "We are indeed having trouble getting convictions and accountability, and so are other countries," said Eugene R. Fidell, president of the National Institute of Military Justice. "It has struck me that the sentences are kind of modest."
 Now we have the predicate set. In the first instance, Iraqi investigators should conduct their own investigations into allegations against US servicemembers and in the second, military courts are unduly lenient in punishing those who commit crimes against Iraqi civilians. 
 Today, in the midst of an important story on a battle between Iraqi troops and the Mahdi Army (or Jaish-al-Mahdi as Iâm sure the New York Times will be calling it in the near future) we find this which oddly enough has nothing to with the Mahdi Army or even the general area where the fighting took place:
 Meanwhile, new allegations of indiscriminate killings by U.S. troops surfaced Monday. Relatives and neighbors of seven civilians shot dead during a gun battle in a Baghdad neighborhood on Sunday said U.S. soldiers had stepped out of their vehicles and randomly fired at their car. 
 "The soldiers decided to kill everyone on the streets, and my mother was one of them," Mohammed Sabah al-Dulaimi, 19, an engineering student said in a telephone interview. "They were angry. There's no other reason for killing. They took revenge."
 It seems to be a safe bet that we will see more of these stories, more allegations that military courts are too lenient, and more calls for Iraqis to be involved in the investigative process. In no prosecutions arise from the Haditha investigation, and at the rate at which those allegations are imploding (see here | here | here for coverage contra Murthaâs dubious version of events) that is an increasingly possible outcome, we can count on a full-court press to remove investigations from military jurisdiction. 
 Implicit in this demand will be the idea that we have to prove to the Iraqis that we are fair and impartial in meting out justice in order to strengthen the hand of the Iraqi government, to reduce the power of the militias (how long before a fawning story appears on how the only reason the Mahdi Army exists is to protect the people from US forces?), and to bring the Sunnis into the political process. Against this laudable goal what chance does a young sergeant or lance corporal or lieutenant have? 
 Not much more than Harry Morant or Peter Handcock.

TITLE: Obama wants to claim he's distancing Democrats from lobbyists, without actually doing so


TEXT:

 By Erick Posted in 2008 — Comments (3) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Barack Obama has sent the Democratic Party reeling today in his first official act as nominee. He's taken over the party and banned money from lobbyists.
Will he ban Lottie Shackelford from the building? She is the DNC's Vice-Chair and she is a registered lobbyist. Will Obama actually live up to the expectation he set â dare I say the "spirit" of his intentions â or was his statement banning lobbyist money "just words"?
What about Linda Chavez-Thompson , the other DNC Vice-Chair? She has been a lobbyist for the AFL-CIO.
And will Obama take down links to the DCCC and DSCC from the DNC website? Thus far, the DCCC refuses to adhere to the nominee's wishes. The DCCC is glad to accept lobbyist dollars. The DSCC is thus far offering no comment.
It's a poor sign that the nominee can't get the party to listen to him. It's even a worse sign that his statement appears to be "just words."

The Genetic Non-Discrimination Act misses the point of insurance By Neil Stevens Posted in Health care | Medical Insurance | Missing the Point | Policy — Comments (5) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Via Slashdot Science (so it's a week old), President Bush signed the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act into law on the 22nd. This bill would prevent the proper assessment of medical risk based on improving medical technology, increasing the costs of medical insurance for all Americans, which of course shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what insurance is.
To be fair, though, there was only one vote in the House against this bill, and none at all in the Senate, so this silliness extends beyond the Presidency and to our entire caucuses in the Congress.
Read on...
In essence, insurance is a gamble. You, the purchaser of insurance, are betting that at some point, you will get sick/lose your house in a flood/get in a wreck/die prematurely. The only reason anyone would take such a bet, is that the insurance company both gets to set the amount of money you must bet, the payoff if you "win," and conditions in the contract that make it an unfair bet.
So life insurance won't pay off if your death is self-inflicted, flood insurance can't be purchased in the private market in areas that flood routinely, and people with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be insured for coverage of those conditions . To buy insurance on that last point, is analogous to betting on the roulette wheel after the wheel was already spun, and the ball already fell on its number. It's not fair to the house, and in insurance, the insurance provider is the house.
Yet, Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) is cheering this and Republicans are quietly going along with it:
 "This is a tremendous victory for every American not born with perfect genes - which means it's a victory for every single one us," said Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY). "Since all of us are predisposed to at least a few genetic-based disorders, we are all potential victims of genetic discrimination."
"Today marks the beginning of a new era in health care," continued Slaughter. "Americans can finally take advantage of the tremendous potential of genetic research without the fear that their own genetic information will be used against them."
The 22nd did mark a new era of medical care; on that I agree. It marked the day Republicans rolled over without a fight on an attack straight at the heart of free market medicine. Our ability to pool risks and pay for medicine privately is endangered if insurance firms cannot account for risks properly by avoiding the sure losses of pre-existing conditions. So when this bill exacerbates the problem, and the push for socialized medicine continues, let's remember who to thank.

TITLE: From the department of "Invading your privacy for absolutely NO legitimate reason" comes...


TEXT:

 By Jeff Emanuel Posted in Law — Comments (14) / Email this page » / Leave a comment » ...the creation of a National Fingerprint Registry as part of the Home Loan Bailout bill
 Apparently in the name of preventing people who can't afford mortgages from getting "swindled" by lenders who have been strongly encouraged by the federal government to offer mortgages to those same people who can't afford them (whew! that's a mouthful), the federal government is incorporating into its mortgage bailout legislation the creation of a National Fingerprint Registry.
Not that they'd want you to know that, though. As CNET reported : What's a little odd is the lack of public discussion about this new fingerprint database. No mention of it appears in the official summary of the revised Senate bill. No fingerprint database requirement is in the House version of the legislation approved earlier this month. No copy of the revised Senate legislation is posted on the Library of Congress' Thomas Web site, which would be the usual procedure.
This database, which would incorporate anybody even remotely related to the housing and home loan markets, is, according to Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA), an attempt to remedy the fact that "today the rules governing mortgage brokers and lenders are inadequate...just a patchwork of regulation."
So the answer is to massively invade the privacy of anybody who might buy, sell, or offer loans for the buying or selling of, a home? Really?
What is the real need and cause for such an invasion of biometric privacy -- and where does this stop? It strikes me as strange to say the least that the creation of a terrorist fingerprint registry, or attempts to monitor overseas calls, are being subject to far more protestation and scrutiny than a plan to treat home sellers and lenders in a similar fashion. When applied to suspected terrorists, this treatment causes both people and Senators to loudly and publicly protest -- but when applied to "home loan originators," will the feds get a free pass? 
John Berlau at CEI is thinking along similar lines: We have wrenching debates about privacy and freedom vs. national security when it comes to proposed anti-terrorist programs. But then a smililar scheme is done in response to an economic problem, and it almost escapes without notice. A similar thing has happened with anti-money laundering requirements that mandate that banks effectively spy on their customers for possible violations of everything from drug laws to the tax code.
The invasion of privacy that this represents is only part of the matter, of course; creating this database also opens up a whole new group pf people to identity theft , as well, simply because of an overreaching whim of the federal government.
You know, in Britain, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society -- for reasons known only to Queen and country -- has jurisdiction and authority to perform "the interception of communications, the acquisition and disclosure of data relating to communications, the carrying out of surveillance, the use of covert human intelligence sources and the acquisition of the means by which electronic data protected by encryption or passwords may be decrypted or accessed" -- and, inexplicably, has tribunal powers, as well.
Do we really want to start down that road ourselves?

TITLE: The Tunes, They Are A'Changin'


TEXT:

 By Pejman Yousefzadeh Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Flip-Flopping | Obamafiles — Comments (2) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
I think that this speaks for itself:
"There is no reason why we would necessarily meet with [Iranian president Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad before we know that he is actually in power," Mr. Obama told reporters. "He is not the most powerful person in Iran." 
 Last week, Mr. Obama offered a similarly nuanced explanation about meeting with President Raúl Castro of Cuba, saying he would do so only "at a time and place of my choosing." 
 The caveats belie the simple answer Mr. Obama gave during a debate last summer, when the issue was first raised in a major public forum. Without hesitation or qualification, Mr. Obama said he would hold direct talks with America's enemies, drawing strong and immediate criticism from his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. 
 "Would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?" asked Stephen Sixta, a video producer who submitted the question for the CNN/YouTube Democratic debate. 
 Mr. Obama, the first candidate to respond, answered, "I would." 
 Several aides immediately thought it was a mistake and sought to dial back his answer. But on a conference call the morning after the debate, Mr. Obama told his advisers that he had meant what he said and thought the answer crystallized how he differed from his rivals. 
 "I think that it is an example of how stunted our foreign policy debates have become over the last eight years that this is an issue that political opponents try to seize on," Mr. Obama said in an interview on Wednesday. "It is actually a pretty conventional view of how diplomacy should work traditionally that has fallen into disrepute in Republican circles and in Washington." 
 Even after Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called his position naïve, Mr. Obama refused to shy away from it, at times speaking explicitly in terms of a potential meeting with Mr. Ahmadinejad.
 And now, of course, he's backing away from it. That's the New Tone for you. The utter and complete shift in positioning--without anything dramatic having occurred to cause it save the fact that Obama is now realizing that his earlier stance doesn't play well before a general election crowd--should have the mainstream media all over him in the most critical fashion. 
 At least, if there is such a thing as "critical inquiry" these days.

For Sunday, June 8, 2008

FOX News Sunday (FNS): Host Chris Wallace chats with potential veeps: Governors Tim Pawlenty (R-Minnesota) and Tim Kaine (D-Virginia).
This Week (ABC): Host George Stephanopoulos has Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) on the air as surrogates to argue about the Presidential election, then Senator Dianne Feinstein will talk about the historic secret summit between Clinton (Hillary) and Obama.
Meet the Press (NBC): Host Tim Russert has a roundtable with a bunch of NBC News reporters: Ron Allen, Lee Cowan, David Gregory, Andrea Mitchell, Kelly O'Donnell, and Chuck Todd.
Face the Nation (CBS): Host Bob Schieffer has Hillary's mouthpiece Howard Wolfson, then turns to Representative Chuck Rangel (D-New York) and Senator Jim Webb (D-Virginia).
Late Edition (CNN): Host Wolf Blitzer will interview Senators Jon Kyl (R-Arizona) and Bobby Casey (D-Pennsylvania), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) and Feinstein, and his usual cast of thousands.
= = = = =
The Senate's two "dumb guys" are on display this week in Jim Webb (FTN) and Junior Casey (LE), a sure contributor to the morning's mirth. The surrogate thing is going on again. 
DiFi's not going to spill the beans on that irrelevant get-together between Barry and Hillary at her DC home, one which I mockingly call "historic" merely because it has caught the scorned media's imagination.
And Russert continues his painful habit of interviewing official pundits and unofficial pundits (reporters). At least we'll know what the Washington Press Corp thinks, but I do not understand how he talk to NBC News folks with including their two brightest stars: Chris Matthews and the sportscaster Keith Olbermann.
I'll be by early tomorrow afternoon (ET) with a review of these shows, and I should be in a better mood by then.

TITLE: Obama should meet with Petraeus in Iraq, without preconditions


TEXT:

after all, he did say he would meet with adversaries By Charles Bird Posted in 2008 — Comments (3) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Within the first weeks after receiving enough delegates to secure the nomination, Barack Obama should go to Iraq and meet with General Petraeus without preconditions. There would be a lot of preparation . The first steps would not be to pre-judge all the items on the list. 
More below the fold...
Obama hasn't been to Iraq since January 2006 , before the Golden Mosque bombing by al Qaeda. A lot has happened since then. Last Monday, John McCain invited Obama to join him on his upcoming visit to Iraq. The Obama campaign flatly rejected the offer. Bill Burton , campaign spokesman:
John McCain's proposal is nothing more than a political stunt, and we don't need any more 'Mission Accomplished' banners or walks through Baghdad markets to know that Iraq's leaders have not made the political progress that was the stated purpose of the surge. The American people don't want any more false promises of progress, they deserve a real debate about a war that has overstretched our military, and cost us thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars without making us safer.
I'm pretty sure McCain won't pull out a 'Mission Accomplished' banner on a joint trip, and I'm also pretty sure that Obama could exclude any walks with McCain through Baghdad markets. Ed Morrissey :
If theyâre worried about the military giving them a dog-and-pony show, the answer isnât to decline the trip but to counterpropose a more comprehensive trip than even McCainâs suggesting and turn it into a real fact-finding mission. Donât spend two hours looking at charts with Petraeus. Take four or five days; go to Basra and Mosul. If they simply canât suspend campaigning for that long, send a joint team of advisors from both sides.
After all, Iraq is in the top two of top-two issues in this country. It seems reasonable to me that Obama should go there and see for himself what's taking place, and get his information directly from the source (or sources). In addition to Mosul and Basra, perhaps he could even go to Diyala province now that it's been pacified . Anyway, it's heartening to hear that Obama is at least considering going there:
Senator Barack Obama said today that he is considering visiting American troops and commanders in Iraq this summer. He declined an invitation from Senator John McCain to take a joint trip to Iraq, saying, "I just donât want to be involved in a political stunt."
In a brief interview here, Mr. Obama said his campaign was considering taking a foreign trip after he secures the Democratic presidential nomination. No details have been set, he said, but added: "Iraq would obviously be at the top of the list of stops."
[...]
Mr. Obama suggested today that any foreign itinerary would include a stop in Iraq. "I think that if Iâm going to Iraq, then Iâm there to talk to troops and talk to commanders, Iâm not there to try to score political points or perform," Mr. Obama said. "The work theyâre doing there is too important."
Mr. McCain responded with a touch of sarcasm to the news that Mr. Obama was thinking about going to Iraq. "I certainly was just a short time ago glad to hear that Senator Obama is now, quote, considering a trip to Iraq," Mr. McCain said at a news conference late in the day in Los Angeles. "Itâs long overdue, itâs been 871 days since he was there. And Iâm confident that when he goes he will then change his position on the conflict in Iraq, because he will see the success that has been achieved on the ground."
Again, Ed Morrissey :
Just so weâre clear, a "political stunt" would be letting McCain cow him into a joint trip to Iraq. Letting McCain cow him into a solo trip? Not a stunt.
It would also be interesting to see if Obama does change his 16-month cut-and-run policy after a visit to Iraq, considering that there are strong indicators that the strategy is working *. I'm doubtful that he will. Why? Because his "plan" is too diametrically opposed to the current strategy, and in my view, he's too politically invested to change it because such a change would anger and inflame the very base that propelled him to the nomination. There would be hell to pay from the Hard Partisan Left. Obama's withdrawal proposal is a direct and complete rejection of the counterinsurgency strategy crafted by General Petraeus, and his opposition to the strategy has been longstanding. Here's what Obama said on January 5, 2007:
Meanwhile, Obama said he told the president directly that an "escalation of troop levels in Iraq was a mistake."
Obama was among more than a dozen senators of both parties who were invited to the White House to discuss his plans for Iraq. Bush plans to continue to meet with lawmakers and is expected to announce his new Iraq strategy next week in an address to the nation.
"It was an open-ended discussion," Obama told reporters after the meeting. "The president asked for our opinions. I think both Republican and Democratic senators expressed grave concern about the situation in Iraq."
"I personally indicated that an escalation of troop levels in Iraq was a mistake and that we need a political accommodation, rather than a military approach to the sectarian violence there," said Obama.
Asked for the president's reaction, Obama said: "I think he is considering it very carefully. They've obviously run that possibility through the traps. He did not say definitively that that's the decision he had made."
No specific figure was mentioned for the proposed increase in troops during the meeting, Obama said.
The COIN strategy envisions a political accommodation AND a military approach. Obama rejected this, favoring the former but not the latter. On February 16, 2007, the House approved the following resolution: "Congress disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq." It passed 246-182, but the Senate version failed to clear cloture. Obama voted in favor of putting the resolution to a vote.
Twelve months later, Obama's rejection of the present strategy remains in full force and effect. After foreign policy advisor Samantha Power said that Obama's proposal to withdraw all combat brigades in 16 months was a "best case scenario", the Obama campaign disowned her :
Unfortunately, the best-case scenario does not usually apply in Iraq. That is why it was perfectly appropriate for British television reporters to challenge former Obama foreign policy adviser Samantha Power about how he would respond to an unraveling security situation in the country. She gave what seemed like a common-sense response : Obama will be guided by the circumstances on the ground and the advice of his military commanders, and will not be locked into a plan that he produced more than a year earlier while running for president.
Power's candor was evidently too much for the Obama camp, which promptly disowned her remarks.
Michael Dobbs didn't mention that the Obama campaign also disowned Power because she called Hillary Clinton a "monster" on British television. Nevertheless, the campaign directly repudiated both her "best case scenario" remarks and the "Hillary is a monster" comment. The reality may be that Obama will sign on to the Petraeus strategy if elected, but I don't see any indications of it right now. So as it stands, by dint of his "plan", he must believe that our endeavor in Iraq is irretrievably lost, so the only rationale alternative is to remove our troops with haste. Because of the numbers, the logistics, the bases and whatnot, 16 months is pretty hasty and, to me, it's likely that such a rapid departure would conflict with the latest January 2007 NIE on Iraq.
Changing gears a little, last April I wrote a post on Ambassador Crocker's testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Political progress has been made, but surely not as quickly as anyone likes. The main Sunni bloc's recent suspension of talks on national reconciliation is an example of the volatility and fragility of the process. But it is a process. The national government has shown some willingness to incorporate Sunnis into the military forces, but only haltingly. Al Maliki is stronger politically, but he needs to do more.
* Here's another indicator that the COIN strategy is working. News coverage is way down :
During the first 10 weeks of 2007, Iraq accounted for 23 percent of the newshole fornetwork TV news. In 2008, it plummeted to 3 percent during that period. On cable networks it fell from 24 percent to 1 percent, according to a study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism. 
The numbers also were dismal for the country's dailies. By Acuna's count, during the first three months of this year, front-page stories about Iraq in the Bee were down 70 percent from the same time last year. Articles about Iraq once topped the list for reader feedback. By mid-2007, "Their interest just dropped off; it was noticeable to me," says the public editor.
It's not bleeding, so it's not leading.

TITLE: Reports Of Its Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated (Part Deux)


TEXT:

 By Pejman Yousefzadeh Posted in Culture | Libertarianism And The Discontent Of Its Detractors — Comments (1) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Being a libertarian-conservative, I am as interested in the political fortunes of libertarianism as I am in those of conservatism. So naturally, when Thomas Frank comes along to play a Packerian role and declaim on "The Tragic Irony of Beltway Libertarianism," I have to wonder whether he has diagnosed some strange political disease in the libertarian community. 
 After even the most cursory examination, it becomes quite clear that Frank's piece on libertarianism is as overwrought and inaccurate as Packer's on conservatism. One cannot help but wonder whether Packer and Frank were frustrated funeral directors before they became pundits, but each of them tries to pronounce as dead or dying a political ideology that refuses to conveniently fade away.
Consider the poor Washington libertarian. Everywhere else in America his type is an exotic species, a coffee-shop heretic who quotes from "Atlas Shrugged" and steers every conversation toward Ron Paul or gold.
 Consider poor Thomas Frank, needing to start off his column with a stereotype. Not all libertarians like Ron Paul or Ayn Rand or are obsessed with the gold standard. In fact, I dare say that few of them are. But as we shall see, Frank doesn't have much weaponry in his rhetorical arsenal. Take away the ridicule he dishes out and he will have none whatsoever.
Not so the Beltway variety. Here, in the very home of the taxing, regulating leviathan, the libertarian is such a commonplace and unremarkable bird that no one gives him a second glance. Here he is a factotum of the establishment, a tiny voice in a vast choir assembled by business and its tax-exempt front groups to sing the virtues of the entrepreneur.
 Libertarians are "factotums of the establishment" in Washington? I only wish! Perhaps then the bureaucracy would be slashed, the regulatory state scaled back and power given back to states and localities. It's not fair for Frank to tease us with an untruth like that. Some of us might become unduly optimistic about the state of affairs in Washington.
No, we are not done. Read on . . .
And therein lies his dilemma. Almost by definition, our young libertarian's job is to celebrate the profit motive from the offices of a not-for-profit organization. He is subsidized, in other words, to hymn the unsubsidized way of life. Rugged individualism may be his creed, but a rugged individual he ain't.
 Since when are libertarians "subsidized"? What on Earth is Frank writing about? Does he himself know?
This is more than just an abstract problem, as I discovered last week at a panel discussion hosted by America's Future Foundation, one of the lesser libertarian nonprofits in the city. The questions that night were whether nonprofit work constituted a "real job" and if moving to the private sector was "selling out" - ideas well known to any liberal do-gooder. 
 The audience of young professionals learned about the need to find a job that you loved. It heard the inevitable complaint that "there are plenty of people who are choosing for-profit over nonprofit" when their heart tells them to do the opposite. A panelist asked the audience to imagine a foundation worker saying to his boss, "I love what I do, but in the end I've got a wife and three kids, and we live in McLean, and the mortgage is through the roof, and my commute sucks, or whatever, I need a little bit more cash," only to have his employer turn him down. 
 These plaints sounded so familiar that I felt like suggesting that everyone there hop out and grab a copy of Daniel Brook's fine but distinctly unlibertarian 2007 book "The Trap." By skewing society's rewards so lopsidedly to the top in the country's richest cities, Mr. Brook writes, the tax-reducing, market-minded economic policies of the last few decades have priced all sorts of high-minded occupations to the bottom of the middle class: teaching, the arts, and, of course, nonprofit work.
 Of course, it is the wealthy that pay the bulk of taxes , which is why they get the most significant share of tax breaks . But let not the facts stand in the way of Thomas Frank's snarky commentary. I don't know why it comes as a shock to Frank to learn this but here is a stark truth: High-paying jobs in the private sector will have salaries that outdistance those of people engaged in "teaching, the arts, and, of course, nonprofit work." Tax reductions and "market-minded economic policies" have had little--at best--to do with the phenomenon.
But what is it that libertarians are selling when they accept the fat paychecks of corporate America? The noble principle of self interest? The utopia of the market itself? Will the workings of supply and demand really seize up if some young Ayn Randette chooses to forsake, say, the Cato Institute and instead help ExxonMobil pile up the pelf?
 "Ayn Randette." Stay classy, Thomas. Stay classy.
Fortunately, there were a few plainspoken men of the market present at the gathering to set things straight. Capitalists were the world's real heroes, they reminded us, delivering value to the public and seeing that value quantified precisely by the numbers on the balance sheet. That was reality. the idea that "there's something special about nonprofits," scoffed one forthright fellow - "well, that's crap. Nonprofits are an artifice of the law, and what's special about them is not that they do different things or that they are organized in a special way, it's that they don't pay taxes." 
 Personally, I would take this hard line one step further: Selling out is not a threat to the market order; selling out is how the market gets its way. Just look at the city in which all these remarks were made. Private-sector Washington is one of the wealthiest places in America. Public-service Washington lags considerably behind. The chance of ditching the one for the other is what accounts for everything from the power of K Street to the infamous "revolving door," by which a public servant takes a cushy corporate job after engineering some extravagant government favor for the corporation in question - or its clients.
 Actually, private-sector Washington is richer because there is greater competition for private sector jobs--many of which will require some time in the public sector so as to provide private sector clients with an inside view of how government works. Private-sector Washington gives you a higher salary but less job security than your traditional, public-sector bureaucrat. Still, many people will take their chances with job security because they want the higher salaries. It has nothing to do with "selling out" and "selling out" is not how the market "gets its way," as anyone reasonably familiar with market economics would understand. 
 But hey, don't take my word for it. On these issues, let's turn the microphone over to Ilya Somin , who tears Frank apart:
Frank's first fallacy is the assumption that libertarianism is about the "celebration" of the "profit motive." In reality, libertarianism advocates the superiority of the private sector over government. Parts of that private sector are mainly driven by the profit motive, others are not (e.g. - families, many civil society organizations). There is nothing in libertarianism that is inconsistent with working in a "subsidized" organization so long as the subsidies don't come from the state. On the other hand, many government programs are themselves driven by the profit motive: for example, government subsidies for large agribusinesses; protectionism for powerful domestic economic interests, and so on. Libertarians have no problem denouncing these programs despite the fact that they arise from the profit-seeking of their beneficiaries. 
 The second fallacy is the assumption that libertarians defend the interests of "business." On some issues, that is indeed true. But it is not a general rule. There are many, many, businesses that lobby for and depend on government handouts of various sorts. Libertarians and libertarian organizations - including the "beltway libertarian" groups that Frank attacks in his piece - regularly criticize these businesses and the government programs that benefit them. Indeed, as I discussed in this post , libertarian groups have often had to distance themselves from business interests in order to be effective - precisely because the latter often have an interest in promoting big government. 
 Finally, Frank makes the common but wholly untenable claim that today's government policies are mostly market driven and that the market has somehow crowded out "public service" - thereby rendering libertarian advocacy unnecessary, or at least superfluous. This is simply false, given the reality that government spending at all levels is more than one third of GDP, that regulation is also at very high levels, and both have grown massively during the years of the Bush Administration .
 And let's give Jonathan Adler a turn at the mike:
What Frank seems to overlook, however, is that "private-sector Washington" is only so wealthy because of the public sector. Washington, D.C. is a company town -- and the hometown company is immune to recession. And as the government grows, so does the economic value of influencing government decisions. Were Beltway Libertarians to get their way, lobbyists and political consultants would not be worth so much. In such a world, Washington would be quite a sleepy place, and "selling out" would involve finding a productive, wealth-creating job out in the "real world," not signing up with a Beltway bandit or other hired gun.
 Jason Kuznicki tries to beat some sense into Frank's head as well :
No, let's not consider the beltway libertarian. Or at least, let's not consider him all alone. Instead, let's look at a couple of money trails. Here's the first one: Consumers buy products because they want or need them. An entrepreneur, who has supplied these products, collects the money, which the consumer has given of his own free will. The entrepreneur gives some of this money to his investors, some to his employees, and some he keeps for himself as a just reward. The entrepreneur, his investors, or his employees give a portion of that money to a libertarian think tank like the Cato Institute. (Nearly all of Cato's money comes from individual donors, not corporations or foundations.) I work for the Cato Institute, and it pays me a salary. 
There's something remarkable about this money trail: every step is voluntary. Every step is the product of a private, individual decision. None of them are coerced. 
 Maybe I don't live on the shores of Walden Pond. But it's still hard to see how my individualism has been compromised. I might easily change my career direction; my boss might decide he doesn't need my services; the donors might get fed up with Cato and stop giving; the entrepreneur might liquidate his business; the consumers might stop buying the products. At every point in the chain, the individual is in charge, and the same would be true if my own place in the chain were at position #3 rather than position #5. Either way, it's all voluntary, and my libertarian conscience is clean. 
 Yes, yes, I might make more money elsewhere. But money is just one dimension of personal satisfaction. Although money is important, other values are worthwhile too. There's nothing wrong about wanting a job that is personally satisfying, or that is intellectually stimulating, or that furthers your vision of the good. A libertarian appreciates the value and purpose of money (possibly more than most), but he's allowed to have other values, too. It's only cartoon plutocrats who refuse to care about anything else. 
 Now let's look at another money trail. I have a hard time thinking it's the better one: The government takes your money in taxes. If you don't pay, you'll find an unscheduled appointment on your agenda, possibly involving men with guns. The government turns this money over to "nonprofits." Or perhaps to plain old profit-seeking corporations. 
Bit of a difference there, isn't it?
 As Kuznicki points out, the Cato Institute takes no federal money, which cuts the legs out from underneath Frank's ridiculous "subsidization of libertarians" argument. And check out generally Jonah Goldberg , who blows still more holes in Frank's Swiss-cheese argument against "beltway libertarians." 
 The worst kind of columns are those that seek to justify a particular position, no matter how batty, and then reason backwards to do so. Frank's column is a prime example of such a specimen. Overcome by hatred and disgust with the "free-market idol" of libertarians, he writes snidely and accusingly without a single actual fact to support those things he calls "arguments" in his piece. His column is replete with inconsistencies and incoherence and the only thing that it actually accomplishes is allowing Frank to vent his spleen. 
 Which he is perfectly free to do. But why on Earth did the Wall Street Journal find it necessary to darken its column space by letting him do it on its pages? By the way, where were the editors when Frank's piece got submitted? Were they on vacation, or something? Couldn't one of them point out that there was more snark than substance to Frank's piece? And if this is the best that we can expect from Frank, shouldn't a "your services are no longer required" missive come down from the editorial offices of the Journal? I mean, surely it can do better. 
 Can't it?

TITLE: Obama May Visit Iraq, On One Condition


TEXT:

He Would Go to Ensure Defeat By Mark I Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Foreign Policy Inexperience | Hugo Chavez | Iraq | Mahmoud Ahmadinejad | Obamafiles — Comments (58) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
The Obama campaign continues flailing around wildly when challenged on Sen. Obama's lack of foreign policy chops. Last week, Obama flipped and flopped over the issue of his pledge to meet with Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, telling one audience that he would let Chavez set the agenda for such a meeting, and another that Venezuela should be internationally isolated . 
This week, he is trying to "clarify" his promise to meet face to face, without pre-conditions, with the leader of Iran. Even the New York Times recognized the desperation with which the Obama campaign is trying to back off from the candidate's naive views on meeting with America's enemies .
Now Sen. Obama is under fire from Sen. John McCain for not having been to Iraq in over two years. McCain challenged Obama to go to Iraq and see the difference that the troop surge has made in that time. McCain even offered to go with Obama to show him around. The Obama campaign first dismissed the call as a "political stunt." But now it has decided that Obama may indeed go to Iraq, just not to see how American and Iraqi troops are winning the war. Obama wants to go to figure out how to withdraw.
This morning on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Obama campaign Communications Director Robert Gibbs said the following when asked if Obama would consider going to Iraq.
"Well, as he said yesterday Mika, it's under discussion about going overseas and going to Iraq sometime between now and the campaign. You know, I don't think we'll be taking that trip with John McCain because as Senator Obama said yesterday, the work that the men and women in our military are doing over there is just far too important for them to be props in some sort of political stunt or photo-op. You know, what they're doing over there is separated from their families, giving for their country. It's truly, truly amazing, and I think we would want to go over there and talk to them and see what sort of difficulties they're facing and see how it is that we can begin to carefully remove them and carefully bring them back to their families and bring them back to the United States ."
The Obama campaign won't go to see how the U.S. is winning because that would constitute using the troops as "props" in a "political stunt" and "photo-op." But going over to find out the "difficulties" they are having and to figure out how to "begin to carefully remove them" is not? Nonsense.
The real story here is that Obama has no interest in what is really happening in Iraq, unless it fits his predetermined view that the war is lost. The message from the Obama campaign is clear. Sen. Obama would meet with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hugo Chavez without pre-conditions and without pre-judging the agenda items, but he won't go meet with the troops in Iraq unless it is on his terms. He would go to make sure America lost if it would help him win.

Which of these statements prompted Barack Obama to leave Trinity United Church of Christ:
(a) The pastor of his church for twenty years saying "God D-mn America"
(b) The pastor of his church for twenty years blaming the U.S. for 9/11
(c) The pastor of his church for twenty years claiming the U.S. created AIDS to kill black men
(d) A surrogate spiritual mentor guest preaching in his church of twenty years mocking Hillary Clinton
If you guessed "d", you are correct.
For twenty years Barack Obama sat in a pew while hate poured forth. His preacher tore into America, tore into Israel, and expressed solidarity with terrorist regimes like Libya. Obama did nothing.
Even when the spotlight shined brightly on the church, Obama stood by his pastor until it became politically inconvenient.
And now, a guest preacher who said something about Hillary, causes Obama to get conviction enough to leave.
What a standard: you proclaim yourself opposed to America and Obama stands behind you. You mock a Democrat and Obama throws you under the bus.
Again, it is no longer about Obama having no shame. This man has no class.
Oh, and yes, this is another example of Obama caving to the right wing when we turn up the heat. Can't wait to see him cave to China, North Korea, Venezuela, and Iran.

Because. Just because. By Moe Lane Posted in Miscellanea | Normandy | World War II — Comments (14) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »



I have also to announce to the House that during the night and the early hours of this morning the first of the series of landings in force upon the European Continent has taken place. In this case the liberating assault fell upon the coast of France. An immense armada of upwards of 4,000 ships, together with several thousand smaller craft, crossed the Channel. Massed airborne landings have been successfully effected behind the enemy lines, and landings on the beaches are proceeding at various points at the present time. The fire of the shore batteries has been largely quelled. The obstacles that were constructed in the sea have not proved so difficult as was apprehended. The Anglo-American Allies are sustained by about 11,000 firstline aircraft, which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle. I cannot, of course, commit myself to any particular details. Reports are coming in in rapid succession. So far the Commanders who are engaged report that everything is proceeding according to plan. And what a plan! This vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever taken place. It involves tides, wind, waves, visibility, both from the air and the sea standpoint, and the combined employment of land, air and sea forces in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and cannot be fully foreseen.
There are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been attained, and we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises during the course of the fighting. The battle that has now begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks to come, and I shall not attempt to speculate upon its course. This I may say, however. Complete unity prevails throughout the Allied Armies. There is a brotherhood in arms between us and our friends of the United States. There is complete confidence in the supreme commander, General Eisenhower, and his lieutenants, and als6 in the commander of the Expeditionary Force, General Montgomery. The ardour and spirit of the troops, as I saw myself, embarking in these last few days was splendid to witness. Nothing that equipment, science or forethought could do has been neglected, and the whole process of opening this great new front will be pursued with the utmost resolution both by the commanders and by the United States and British Governments whom they serve. 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Speech to the House of Commons, June 6, 1944

TITLE: Barack Obama Is Afraid Of What He Might See In Iraq


TEXT:

Obama Forced To Admit That He Can't Handle The Truth By Dan McLaughlin Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Chickendoves | John McCain | Obamafiles — Comments (23) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
John McCain is a believer in seeing things with his own eyes, as a result of which he has visited Iraq several times during the current war (at least 7 at last count). McCain wrote in his 1999 memoir about how much his grandfather and father, both admirals, valued the ability to go face-to-face with the men on their ships and commanders and field troops on the ground to learn more about the men in their command and the developments in the war they were fighting (World War II and then Vietnam). It's a lesson he's carried through to his role as a Senator and now presidential candidate supporting the mission in Iraq.
Barack Obama, by contrast, has made just one brief trip to Iraq in 2006; he's seen nothing of the facts on the ground since Gen. Petraeus instituted the "surge" and accompanying counterinsurgency strategy. Obama may fancy his policy to be 'reality-based,' but the reality he's interested in is years out of date.
Sen. McCain, looking to take advantage of a classic opportunity to make political hay from this contrast while making an offer to actually educate the man who might well be Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces at war (including, yes, McCain's two sons), yesterday challenged Obama to join him in a joint factfinding trip to Iraq :
"He really has no experience or knowledge or judgment about the issue of Iraq and he has wanted to surrender for a long time," the Arizona senator added. "If there was any other issue before the American people, and you hadn't had anything to do with it in a couple of years, I think the American people would judge that very harshly."...
"I go back every few months because things are changing in Iraq," he said. McCain questioned whether Obama has ever been briefed by Petraeus. "I would also seize that opportunity to educate Senator Obama along the way."
Obama has now rejected that offer, with the following response :
We don't need any more 'facts' to know that this war has been lost. The American people donât want any new 'facts' or 'information,' they deserve a real debate in which we say the same things we have been saying for five years and come to the same conclusions.
Oh, sorry, that's what I heard when I read it. Here's the actual wording, with some window-dressing on the same basic message:
Read On...
John McCain's proposal is nothing more than a political stunt, and we donât need any more 'Mission Accomplished' banners or walks through Baghdad markets to know that Iraq's leaders have not made the political progress that was the stated purpose of the surge. The American people don't want any more false promises of progress, they deserve a real debate about a war that has overstretched our military, and cost us thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars without making us safer.
Obama opposed the 'surge,' proposing instead to withdraw from Iraq beginning in May 2007, with a complete withdrawal to be completed two months ago . The one thing Obama can't afford - especially while he's still courting Democratic primary voters - is to face up to new information showing that he was wrong or needs to change his preferred strategy, the way President Bush did in approving Gen. Petraeus' approach. McCain is betting that Americans want a wartime leader who actually cares what the war looks like from Baghdad to the people charged with fighting it - not what it looks like from the streets of Chicago to the people fighting against the mission.

TITLE: A Fair Reflection of the DNC


TEXT:

Dems being Dems being Dems being Dems. By Mark Kilmer Posted in 2008 | Democrats | DNC | meeting — Comments (7) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
A meeting of the Democratic National Committee's Rules & Bylaws Committee is not engaging television, no matter what the matter. Especially when you just don't care one way or the other.
Sort it out amongst yourselves. Yeah, right.
The real question was: Do they want to have rules? Short answer: not really.
Rules committee member Harold Ickes, Hillary's hit man, asked Congressman Mark Wexler, there from Florida for Obama, if he approved of the DNC's principle of "fair reflection." Wexler seemed unsure. Wexler seemed not to know of any principle by that name, but it has something to do with the delegate delegation reflecting the division of the popular vote.
Fair reflection is big with Ickes/Hillary, especially in Michigan. Ickes Levin went toe-toe-toe with Carl Levin on this matter, and Levin accused Ickes of desiring a "fair reflection of a flawed primary."
Some Obama people think that Barry should receive a fair reflection of those who voted non-committed. There was an unprecedented number of votes for "uncommitted," we're told, and exit polls and Ouija boards inform us that these people were really voting for Barry, who was not on the ballot.
There was a lot of talk of party unity, but it's always couched in terms of: "UNITY BEHIND MY CANDIDATE, NOT YOURS!" That doesn't work. 
I watched on C-SPAN, when I wasn't out getting the groceries. It was also carried, I noticed when checking, by CNN and that other cable news network, the one with the always-outraged sportscaster. FNC carried their money shows in the AM and their general news after noon (ET).
They're going to vote after lunch, and they haven't made the case to me for why I should care. I'll be happy so long as it is a fair reflection of the State of the national Dem apparatus. 
Next time I see Howard Dean, I am going to chant" FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS! â¦"

TITLE: Not buying Obama's hyPACrisy


TEXT:

 By Soren Dayton Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama — Comments (2) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Yesterday, Erick wrote about Barack Obama's misleading statements on his campaign not taking money from PACs. It is interesting how the press is not buying his lies. First, he will take money from MoveOn's PAC . So the guys who insult our soldiers are ok. More examples. The very liberal Baltimore Sun's Swamp blog responds to the line that "[Lobbyists] don't fund my campaign" with the somewhat skeptical response "Lobbyist Ban not for All Dems":
Well, at least not on the presidential level.
The Obama campaign confirms that two other arms of the national party - the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee - will continue to accept lobby and PAC money this election. That's the same position as presumptive Republican nominee John McCain and every affiliate of the Republican National Committee, who all accept lobby and PAC dollars.
More examples of Obama losing this fight below the fold.
USA Today :
The DNC policy announced Thursday does not ban lobbyists from holding top positions within the organization.
Lottie Shackleford, a vice chairman of the DNC, is a lobbyist for insurance firms State Farm and Allstate as well as student lender Sallie Mae. Shackleford did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Paxton declined to comment when asked whether Shackleford's role conflicted with Obama's lobbyist restrictions. Obama spokesman Bill Burton did not respond to messages seeking comment.

TEXT:

AND NEITHER DID THE PRESS By absentee Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Obamafiles | swooning press | Trinity United Church of Christ — Comments (17) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
The media machine is quite something to behold. The process of taking an untruth, an exaggeration, or a misstatement, and turning it into a Known Fact™ is fascinating, if frightening. Take Scott McClellan, for example. Once you thresh the narrative, sort through the interviews, headlines and hype, you find there's nothing there . Here's a business plan for you. Write a book summarizing all the New York Times columns and op-eds from 2001 through 2004. That's all, just summarize them. Slap "Bush Lied" on the cover Await the media's inevitable trumpeting of your book as the one light in an endless night of oppression. Deposit checks.
 Thank me later. 
It's been the same throughout Senator Obama's storied campaign. The idea is that he's a transformative figure. He's a Christ for politics, healing the sick with his perfected health care, turning oil to wine, and making the rivers run clear and blue. 
Of course, the truth is slightly less divine. His campaign has been a series of surrogate scandals, personal scandals, gaffes, mistakes, and oopsies to have easily warranted dumb guy treatment on shows like Saturday Night Live; Quayle's potato has nothing on Obama's 10,000 dead . Nevertheless, he yet glides on a soft cloud of adoration. He is the untouchable, the unassailable. He is the Obama. At least in the press it is so. 
So now we have another "narrative" spreading. Witness an LA Times editorial from this morning. The dismayed tone is regretful, shaming the rest of us for hurting this poor church, for separating the Obama from his flock. The Washington Post ran a story that is filled with a number of interesting facts, but which too has a tone of mournful sadness. The New York Times reports on the "battered" congregants of Trinity, who, we are assured, will "go on worshiping as ever." 
Poor Barack, pushed from his church home by an evil nation. Poor Trinity, suffering at the unjust, unseen hand of infamy. Tragic.
There is a lot that isn't being said in these obituaries. Reporters and columnists have happily jumped on the new meme that it's all a big, unfair, out of context comedy of errors. It is immediately being taken for granted that the church really hadn't done wrong in the first place. Victims of circumstance and the cruelty of selective YouTubery. Wright was really right most of the time. Moss is mostly benign. Father Pfleger is a friendly but infrequent visitor, not representative. Yes the press is leaving out a lot of information, and why not? They take their cues from the Obama, and the Obama had a lot to not say as well.

Senator Obama did not say, for example, that America is not the " greatest sin against God. " Father Pfleger thinks it is. Senator Obama, and the press, instead emphasize that the fired up Father is but a guest. Nevermind the hearty reception he received from the congregants, he's a guest speaker. Nevermind the many times he's previously been a guest speaker, or his warm receptions then. Nevermind his press statements during the early days of the Wright controversy, wherein he reinforced the closeness of the church to Louis Farrakhan and was sought as a voice of the church. He's a guest. Nevermind that the church reflects their philosophy in their choice of their frequent guest speakers, and that Senator Obama's philosophy is reflected in his choice of church. Nevermind that he's a candidate for President who is tied by any string to such comments and should condemn them by name and specifically. No no, Pfleger was just a guest ... a divisive, backward-looking guest, that's all.
Of course, despite that he couldn't bring himself to condemn any remarks specifically, he managed to praise Father Pfleger specifically, calling him a friend and someone who has done "tremendous" work in Chicago. He could no more condemn him, in other words, than he could condemn any correct friend who is tremendous. Still, though, just a divisive, backward-looking guest speaker who, if anything, is suffering from Obama's campaign.
Senator Obama, and by extension the mainstream media, also did not say that the congregation, including he and his family, ought to have spoken up in the twenty years of Reverend Wright's offensive conspiracy-theorizing and America-bashing, rather than cheering and applauding. He doesn't say that the congregants and he and his family should have spoken up against anti-Semitism or racism in twenty years of enduring it, rather than waving their hands triumphantly and shouting "Amen!" Instead, he and the press want the church to be allowed to worship in "peace." 
Nevermind that the various Reverends and guests repeatedly name America "the enemy" and accuse both the nation and the people of current ongoing atrocities in anything but peaceful tirades. Nevermind that the church posts letters from radical Palestinian activists and echoes radical Palestinian groups that are the enemies of peace in the Middle East and the world. Nevermind that Louis Farrakhan, friend of the church and personal security provider to the Wright Reverend preaches the need for a holy war against the American government. Obama wants them all to worship in peace, free from the violence of being accurately quoted and videos of their actual sermons shown publicly. 
What Senator Obama continues not to say is something he cannot say. Trinity United Church of Christ has a pulpit of division and hate. The Church, its pastors and guests, have spent twenty-plus years excitedly spewing what Obama is supposedly eschewing. What Obama doesn't say, what he can't say, is that he has associated with anti-Semitic, anti-American and racist rhetoric for most of his adult life. 
A friend asked me what Obama can say at this point about Trinity. She thought he'd said enough, that he'd been clear, that he left the church, what more can he possibly do? It's simple really. There's nothing he can do. He sat there and shared in Trinity's guilt for twenty years. He can't transfigure his way out of it. 
Judging by the press, he probably won't have to. They've already bought in to the new story. Trinity is a battered congregation, huddling together, trying to make it. It's an assault on them, you see. Soon enough, the motivations of those who question Trinity will be boiled down to good old fashioned American racism. Obama, then, will be the magnanimous man who made the ultimate sacrifice. The hero who cut himself off from his own church, set himself free in the world to battle on without his support structure, alone against mean America ... to save them from us. 
The story is being rewritten and rewritten. They want their story to become The Story ; and their press acolytes are ready to sanctify and testify. The Obama has made his great sacrifice, beatification at eleven.

The Washington Post's Richard Cohen , writing about Barack Obama's problems with his numerous and contradictory statements on Iran says: I attribute Obama's predicament to inexperience and a certain worrisome naivete . When he said he would personally negotiate with Iran (if he were president), he might not have realized exactly what he was saying . 
That about nails it.
And if he doesn't know what he is saying now, what is he going to do as President?

TITLE: Michael Kinsley Does Not Get It:  The Real Victims of Obama's Radical Friends


TEXT:

Let's Try It This Way: Terrorists Are Bad. Decent People Should Not Befriend Them. By Dan McLaughlin Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Bill Ayers | Michael Kinsley | murder | Obamafiles — Comments (38) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Michael Kinsley thinks that Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn are not really such a big deal except to the extent they inadvertently helped Republicans:
Ayers and Dohrn never posed any real threat to U.S. national security . Their asinine chatter about killing people and their anti-American sloganeering were as ineffective as their bombs. But they did real harm. Their victims were liberals : the millions of people who were part of the mainstream antiwar movement and who later voted against Ronald Reagan...perhaps you can imagine how infuriating it was to the organizers of the big marches on Washington--struggling to keep them peaceful--that there were people of the left effectively in cahoots with the Nixon Administration , determined to undermine all those efforts.
Um, no. Kinsley admits right up front in the article the violent radicalism of the Weather Underground and its (and, specifically, Dohrn's) implication in, among other atrocities, the 1981 Brink's armored car robbery at the Nanuet Mall in my hometown, a robbery that killed Nyack Police Officer Waverly Brown, Nyack Police Sergeant Ed O'Grady and Brink's security guard Pete Paige, who collectively left behind three widows and six fatherless children , the youngest six months of age. I can promise you that I would not associate willingly with the likes of Ayers and Dohrn if they were on fire and I was carrying a bucket of water. Nor would most of the people who remember the Brink's case. Kinsley and Obama, perhaps, were still too angry about Nixon and Reagan to care.
The problem with folks like Ayers and Dohrn was not that they made the political lives of liberals difficult. Their real victims were the people killed by their organization. I vividly remember the Brink's robbery; it was the biggest news story ever in Rockland County. When I worked at the Rockland DA's office for a summer they took us to see the evidence, including the super-thick windshield glass from the armored Brink's truck that had a huge hole blown in it by their shotguns and M-16s .
So, maybe Ayers and Dohrn were not actually going to bring the United States to its knees. They did quite enough harm, thank you. Tim McVeigh never posed any real threat to U.S. national security, either. Nor did Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, or the Klu Klux Klan. Would Kinsley be unconcerned about a presidential candidate who counted those associations among his friends? Maybe next he'll just explain it away as a necessary part of politics, like pandering to Marxists .
Kinsley instead suggests that at worst Obama is sorely lacking in....judgment. Read On...
If Obama's relationship with Ayers, however tangential, exposes Obama as a radical himself, or at least as a man with terrible judgment, he shares that radicalism or terrible judgment with a comically respectable list of Chicagoans and others--including Republicans and conservatives--who have embraced Ayers and Dohrn as good company, good citizens, even experts on children's issues. Northwestern created a "family justice" center for Dohrn to run. Ayers is a "distinguished professor" at the University of Illinois. They write Op-Eds and are often quoted in the Tribune, where, if they are identified at all beyond their academic titles, it is usually as "activists" who have never abandoned their noble ideals.
Barack Obama: judgment no worse than that of Chicago academics and newspapermen. What an endorsement. 
I'll leave you with some people who one would have preferred to associate with, but who don't seem to be the types that run in Barack Obama's circles:
Police Officer Waverly Brown, 45, sipped his coffee while sitting in the diner on Broadway in the village of Nyack, New York on the afternoon of October 20, 1981. Nyack was a small community of 6,000 people situated on the banks of the majestic Hudson River. Officer Brown, known to virtually everyone as "Chipper," was a popular figure in the village, especially to young people, who frequently saw him as a counselor and friend. He was on the job for 13 years and, since the retirement of another African American, Officer Brown was the only black cop on the 22-man force. He served in the United States Air Force after the Korean War and later both his daughters also joined the military. When he finished his 20 years with the police, Chipper planned to retire to Virginia where he owned a house and some land. He was a solid six feet tall, had an easy smile and loved to garden and cook. He finished his coffee, tipped the waitress and walked out to his parked police unit.
At the same time, a short distance away in the Nyack Police Department radio room, Sergeant Ed O'Grady, 33, was talking with the police dispatcher. O'Grady was born and raised in Nyack. He knew everyone and everyone knew him. He served with the Marines in the Vietnam War during the 1960s and when he returned home, he joined the police department. O'Grady retained the discipline and conservatism of the Marines; his uniform and appearance were always exemplary. He was enrolled at St. Thomas Aquinas College and was close to receiving his bachelor's degree in criminal justice. Ed O'Grady and his wife, Diane, had three small children, Edward, 6, Patricia, 2, and Kimberly, six months.
A few miles away, on Route 59, a busy highway that runs east and west through Rockland County, an armored car was approaching the sprawling Nanuet Mall. Inside the truck, Brink's security guard Pete Paige, 49, was looking forward to the last pickup of the day. He was a hard-working, quiet sort of man and a veteran of the United States Navy. Pete was the guard that day. It was his role on that shift to guard the carrier of the money. Pete and his wife, Josephine, had three children, Susan, 19, Michael, 16, and Peter, age 9. He worked as an armed guard for the Brink's Corporation since 1956 and had never been involved in a robbery.
This would be his first, and his last.

TITLE: I await with some interest Senator Obama's assurance that this will fail.


TEXT:

You know. Quagmires, and all that. By Moe Lane Posted in Barack Obama | DC | Harry Thomas | Miscellanea | The Best Democratic Primary EVER | The Surge — Comments (7) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
After all, he's happy enough to declare similar activities in Iraq failures, and never mind such piddling little details like objective reality (Via Instapundit ):
Lanier plans to seal off rough âhoods in latest effort to stop wave of violence
D.C. police will seal off entire neighborhoods, set up checkpoints and kick out strangers under a new program that D.C. officials hope will help them rescue the city from its out-of-control violence.
Under an executive order expected to be announced today, police Chief Cathy L. Lanier will have the authority to designate âNeighborhood Safety Zones.â At least six officers will man cordons around those zones and demand identification from people coming in and out of them. Anyone who doesnât live there, work there or have âlegitimate reasonâ to be there will be sent away or face arrest, documents obtained by The Examiner show.
Lanier has been struggling to reverse D.C.âs spiraling crime rate but has been forced by public outcry to scale back several initiatives including her âAll Hands on Deckâ weekends and plans for warrantless, door-to-door searches for drugs and guns.
Under todayâs proposal, the no-go zones will last up to 10 days, according to internal police documents. Front-line officers are already being signed up for training on running the blue curtains.
Of course, if Obama does come out against this he'll have to explain to his super-delegate Harry Thomas Jr. why this plan of the Councilman's is doomed to failure, so I expect that the junior Senator from Illinois will handle the situation by ignoring it for as long as possible, and then fire a staffer.

 By Soren Dayton Posted in 2008 | Barack Obama | Hamas | Israel — Comments (15) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Earlier, Mark Kilmer noted that Hamas expressed displeasure at Barack Obama's speech to AIPAC. So what did Obama do? He caved to Hamas.
The Washington Post reported it as " Obama Backtracks on Jerusalem " and Reuters as " Facing criticism, Obama modifies Jerusalem stance ". WaPo: Facing criticism from Palestinians , Sen. Barack Obama acknowledged today that the status of Jerusalem will need to be negotiated in future peace talks, amending a statement earlier in the week that Jerusalem "must remain undivided."
So let's make this very clear. Under pressure from Palestinians and terrorists, Obama caves on perhaps Israel's most fundamental issue. Not a good sign for those meetings with Ahmadinejad.

TITLE: Verb Tension


TEXT:

McCain Campaign Conference Call By absentee Posted in 2008 | John McCain — Comments (46) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
In a conference call with reporters and bloggers today, Sen. Jon Kyl and campaign foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann used and endured the phrase "verb tenses" approximately 57 times. (Actually, maybe it was 48 ... forgive me, I learned Obamath.)
The call was regarding a small dust-up with the Obama camp over a statement Senator McCain made on the campaign trail yesterday. "I can tell you that it is succeeding. I can look you in the eye and tell you it's succeeding. We have drawn down to pre-surge levels. Basra, Mosul and now Sadr city are quiet and it's long and it's hard and it's tough and there will be setbacks."
The Obama campaign is making this out to be a significant error in the facts . (Though one must wonder at the temerity of putting John Kerry out front on an issue of understanding the military. Really, Barack? John Kerry?)
Both Senator Kyl and Randy Scheunemann had opening remarks before taking questions. Senator Kyl emphasized the point that the Obama campaign had latched on to this "verb tense" issue to deflect attention from the fact that the Senator is taking some serious hits from McCain on Iraq. He pointed out that the decision to draw down the troops is done, the preparation is done, and what's left is the actual wrap-up of the draw down, which should conclude in July. 
Scheunemann let loose on Obama from the start, saying that Senator McCain would welcome a real debate over force levels, and that Senator Obama was committed to his narrative of failure, refusing to recognize any successes or improvements as a result of the surge. He also emphasized again that Senator Obama has not been to Iraq since January 2006, a block of time during which Senator McCain has made five trips to Iraq. 
Most of the questions on the call related to, and excessively used the phrase "verb tenses." Reporters pressed for an admission of guilt, and the campaign firmly continued to point out that the underlying point Senator McCain made was fundamentally correct: that the surge has worked, and that as a result, surge troops have been assigned to return home.
Scheunemann made the excellent point that Senator Obama claims this kind of politicking is obsolete, that it is more important to focus on the heart of an issue than the superficial tit for tat of campaigns past. Yet here he is, sending out John Kerry (John Kerry, Senator? Seriously?) to latch onto "verb tense" to try and paint McCain as not in possession of the facts about Iraq.
Still, the point was pressed again and again. And again. Verb tenses. Verb Tenses? Verb Tenses! Verb tenses?! Verb. Ten. Ses. The press seems eager to join the Obama campaign's point of view, which basically amounts to "nevermind about the surge, what is today's date?" 
California Yankee wondered why it is that Senator Obama's Auschwitz alzheimers required dogged attention from bloggers to merit any national reporting, while Senator McCain's ineloquent phrasing of a fundamentally accurate point has them fairly obsessed with the phrase "verb tenses." I have a few verb tenses they seem willing to ignore on behalf of their beloved Senator Obama: Winning, as in we are winning in Iraq; Working, as the surge is working; Visited: as in, Senator Obama visited Iraq some time in the past (verb) tense; Reporting, as in the press is only reporting on Senator Obama's world record string of errors when someone forces them to do so.
What's clear is that Senator Obama doesn't want to talk about the success of the surge. Senator Obama wants to talk about how well Senator McCain phrased his statement. In other words, he's not interested in the facts on the ground, just words ... and verb tenses.

TEXT:

This is what Barry Goldwater was talking about By Neil Stevens Posted in Action Alert | Miscellanea | Red State — Comments (6) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Constant readers may have noticed a quote I had in my comment signature here at Red State:
If we want to take this party back, and I think we can someday, letâs get to work. -- Barry Goldwater
I'm pleased to say that between Red State 3.0's approaching launch, and the current availability of the Action Alerts, it truly is time to get to work.
Read on for the why and how...

We all at Red State, editors and readers, have already found success in terms of national activism and policy development. A personal goal I've had though, a goal shared with others here at Red State, is to build on that success by offering more usefulness at the state and local level. Yes, usefulness. I want Red State to be able to help each and every reader influence the Republican Party in his own community.
It's no secret that a great many Red State readers are unhappy with the state of the party today. We've even had GOP War posts on the front page. But while such rushed, mass national action is useful for heading off particular mistakes the party may make, it does nothing to prevent future mistakes from being made .
That is why we need to shape the party from the ground up. Join the Action Alert system, and we can notify you about conservative and Republican activist opportunities in your community . We can make this work well if enough people join to make the list potent enough though, so please consider joining.
Thank you.

 By Pejman Yousefzadeh Posted in Policy | Privacy | The Subprime Crisis — Comments (0) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Brother Jeff has touched on this issue at significant and valuable length, but it is worth emphasizing that many of the same people who put up a hue and cry--sometimes with a fair amount of justification, it should be noted--against the onset of Big Brother in the United States, went quietly along with the plan to create a national fingerprint database. And for what? To regulate the housing and the home mortgage markets . Recall that intrusive measures to combat terrorism are regularly decried--again, at times for understandable reasons--because they purportedly shred our Constitutional rights and obliterate any and all remnants of our privacy. And yet, the creation of a national fingerprint database actually appears to be moving smoothly through the deliberative process with barely a voice raised in protest in the halls of power. 
 This measure is an ineffective waste of time that will do more to bring about a Brave New World than the USA Patriot Act ever would and yet, no one appears to be making much of a fuss. We are seeing, yet again, the validation of Ronald Reagan's observation that "a government big enough to give you what you want is also big enough to take it away from you," and yet, this story hasn't even graduated to the backburner level. I hear there is a Presidential election this year. I daresay that it would be a marvelous idea for John McCain to run against this plan and against all the other manifestations of Big Government and Big Brother threatening to alter society irredeemably and for the worse. Running against Big Government is good politics, good policy and, as it appears, more needed now than ever. 
 At some point, the meddlesome hand of the regulatory state has to be stayed. If a stand is not taken against this , how much worse will it have to get before we collectively say "enough is enough"?

The disaster , originally known as "Cap and Trade", and now known as the Boxer amendment has been stopped in the Senate [for now]. A "Motion to Invoke Cloture on the Boxer Amdt. No. 4825; In the nature of a substitute" has JUST been defeated. [3/5 majority was not reached] Take THAT, Babs.
Here is the vote tally and I say to all the Senators who voted against cloture "good job folks-well done!"
But...as I am always wont to do, let us advertise the Republicans that voted FOR cloture so they might be given a good scolding by their constituents before the bill actually GETS to a vote...which we KNOW will happen sooner or later:
 Collins (R-ME), Dole (R-NC), Martinez (R-FL), Smith (R-OR), Snowe (R-ME), Sununu (R-NH), Warner (R-VA) 
As an aside, here are the R's "Not Voting":
 Coleman (R-MN), Cornyn (R-TX), Craig (R-ID), DeMint (R-SC), Graham (R-SC), Gregg (R-NH), McCain (R-AZ), Murkowski (R-AK), Specter (R-PA), Stevens (R-AK) 
To the Republicans (and Democrats) that can't stomach sticking it to us little guys anymore?

TITLE: The Way Democrats Count Every Vote


TEXT:

 By California Yankee Posted in 2008 | Democrats | Florida | Michigan | Rules Committee — Comments (1) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Based on what the Press is reporting about the Democrats' great compromise to allow the seating of the previously disenfranchised Florida and Michigan delegations, you may believe you understand that the Democrats reached a reasonable and fair compromise giving each Florida and Michigan delegate half a vote. 
According to the press reports, the Democrats will allow each vote to count and still punish Florida and Michigan for violating the Party's rules about how soon primaries could be held.
That is what the Democrats did for Florida, but not Michigan. 
No, for Michigan the Democrats decided to do a little of their creative counting of every vote. 
Read on, there is more.
According to CNN, Hillary managed to "win" the Michigan Primary:
Clinton - 55% Uncommitted - 40% Kucinich - 4% Dodd - 1% Gravel - 0%
Based upon the votes, Hillary earned 73 delegates and Obama none. Fifty five delegates should be uncommitted.
Instead of agreeing to seat a Michigan delegation based on the actual votes, the Democrats cut a deal to "let every vote count" that "allows" Hillary to have 69 delegates and gives Obama 59 delegates. That's right, even though Obama's name wasn't even on the ballot and therefore no one voted for him, the Democrats are giving him 59 delegates. 
Watch Harold Ickes, one of Hillary's chief advisers, explain the undemocratic nature of the way the Democrats creatively counted Michigan votes:

The Rules and Bylaws Committee, 30 elite members of the Democrat Party substituted their judgment for 600,000 Michigan Voters and gave Obama four pledged delegates specifically won by Hillary and 55 delegates the voters said should be uncommitted. 
Hillary supporters are not happy .
The Democrats' fuzzy math never ceases to amaze me. The way the Democrats decided to count every vote in Michigan reminds me of the way they tried to count Florida votes in 2000.

Just another mistake. Just another blow to the MSM's credibility. Just a little more egg on those supporters' faces. By Jeff Emanuel Posted in 2008 — Comments (46) / Email this page » / Leave a comment »
Lo and behold, after his supporters spent the better part of their mornings defending Obama's claim that his uncle helped (the Red Army) liberate the survivors of Auschwitz concentration camp in 1945 , the campaign came on out and issued a retraction . According to the AP: Barack Obama's campaign says the candidate made a mistake when he said a great uncle helped liberate the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz during World War II. 
Obama said Monday that his uncle was among the first U.S. troops at Auschwitz. But Auschwitz was liberated by Soviet forces.
The campaign said Tuesday that he named the wrong camp. They said it was actually Buchenwald.
Aides said his grandmother's brother, Charlie Payne, helped liberate a Buchenwald sub-camp in April 1945 as part of the 89th Infantry Division. 
Yet another retraction forced by the New Media, after a CBS reporter took the statement at face value and reported it without subjecting it to any of that healthy media skepticism we've spent the last seven-plus years hearing about the importance of.
Ah well.

[H/T Southern Appeal  for the oh so appropriate image]
Fox is reporting that a "Baby Miraculously Survives Abortion, Expected to Live 'Normal' Life":
 "I was on the (birth control pill) when I became pregnant," Percival, 25, said. "Deciding to terminate at eight weeks was just utterly horrible but I couldn't cope with the anguish of losing another baby."
A short time after the abortion, Percival felt a fluttering in her stomach. She went to the doctor for a scan and discovered she was 19 weeks pregnant. [...] In November, Finley was born three weeks premature. He had minor kidney damage but is expected to lead a normal life. 
Hunh...if I remember right, when given the chance to support a law called "Born Alive Infant Protection Act" Barack Obama voted AGAINST this bill "in the Illinois senate and killed it in committee. Twice, the Induced Infant Liability Act came up in the Judiciary Committee on which he served. At its first reading he voted âpresent.â At the second he voted âno.â
Contrary to Obama's belief that women are punished somehow by having babies , it's a good bet Jodie Percival is feeling rightly blessed at the moment.
Elections have consequences, folks. Do we need a "man" like Obama in the White House? I'm fairly sure Finley Percival of Nottinghamshire, England is damn glad Obama will never be Prime Minister of England, given the consequences were Obama to have HIS way.

TITLE: Decline in Teen Sex Levels Off


TEXT:






By Rob Stein
Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, June 4, 2008; 1:59 PM





The nation's campaign to get more teenagers to delay sex and use condoms is faltering, threatening to undermine the highly successful effort to reduce teen pregnancy and protect young people from sexually transmitted diseases, federal officials reported today.



New data from a large government survey shows that by every measure, the decade-long decline in sexual activity among high school students leveled off between 2001 and 2007 and the increase in condom use by teens flattened out in 2003.

Moreover, the survey found disturbing hints that teen sexual activity may actually have begun creeping up and that condom use among high school students might be edging downward, though those trend lines have not yet reached a point where statisticians can be sure, officials said.

"The bottom line is in all these areas we don't seem to be making the progress we were making before," said Howell Wechsler, director of the division of adolescent and school health at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which conducts the survey. "It's very troubling."

Coming on the heels of reports that one in four teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease and that the teen birth rate has increased for the first time in 15 years, the data is triggering alarm across the ideological spectrum.

"We have a number of signs that are all going exactly in the wrong direction," said Sarah S. Brown of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. "All of us in this field are on red alert."

The new report did not examine the reason for the trends, but experts said there could be many causes, including rising complacency about AIDS, changing attitudes about sex and pregnancy, shifts in ethnic diversity and the possibility that there will always be some teens who cannot be convinced to wait.

"The truth is that as a field we really don't know what the answer is," Brown said. "There are lots of theories: the economy, classroom education, the messages kids are getting in the digital world where they spend their time. They probably all play a role."

But the new figures renewed the heated debate about sex education classes that focus on abstinence until marriage, which began receiving federal funding during the period covered by the latest survey and have come under increasing criticism that they are ineffective.

"Since we've started pushing abstinence, we have seen no change in the numbers on sexual activity," said John Santelli, chairman of the Department of Population and Family Health at Columbia University. "The other piece of it is abstinence education spends a good amount of time bashing condoms. So it's not surprising, if that's the message young people are getting, that we're seeing condom use start to decrease."

"We may be witnessing the beginning of a trend where we're reaping the harvest of medically inaccurate and ineffective sex education, which is abstinence-until-marriage sex education," said Michael D. Resnick, who studies teen sexual behavior at the University of Minnesota. "With a growing proportion of young people exposed to those curricula, I think we can begin to understand why we're beginning to see a reversal of the positive trends that had been happening."

Proponents of abstinence programs dismissed the criticism, blaming "comprehensive" sex education that emphasizes contraceptive use.

"Contraceptive sex education does not provide practical skills for maintaining or regaining abstinence but typically gives teens a green light to activity that puts them at great risk for acquiring STDs or which serve as gateway-to-intercourse activities," said Valerie Huber of the National Abstinence Education Association.

The report comes as Congress is debating whether to reauthorize another $50 million in federal funding for sex education programs on top of the $126 million that has already been approved for this year.

Others blamed the onslaught of movies, books, advertising and cultural messages that glamorize sex.

"It's highly ironic this comes out right after the launch of the biggest movie of the season, which is 'Sex in the City.' The No. 1 movie that all teenage girls want to see right now is 'Sex in the City,' " said Charmaine Yoest of the Family Research Council. "Our culture continues to tell them the way to be cool is to dress provocatively and to consider non-marital sexual activity to be normative."

The proportion of teenagers reporting having sexual intercourse rose steadily through the 1970s and 1980s, fueling a sharp rise in teen pregnancy. The trend reversed around 1991 because of AIDS, changing mores about sex and other factors. At the same time, more sexually active teens started using condoms and other forms of contraception. Together, the trends have pushed the U.S. teen pregnancy rate to historic lows.

"This had been one of the great good news stories in the public health field, and now we're at grave risk of seeing the good news turn into bad news," said Brown of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.

The first sign that trend might be reversing came last summer, when the CDC conducted an analysis for The Washington Post of data collected in 2005 by the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative survey the CDC conducts every two years to track a variety of risky behavior, including sexual activity. While the rates still remained far below the all-time highs, the analysis showed that the proportion of teens who said they had ever had sex or had had sex in the last three months had leveled off beginning in 2001. Researchers, however, were waiting for the next round of data to see if it represented a trend.

The new data comes from the 2007 survey , which involved 14,103 students in grades 9 through 12 at 157 high schools nationwide. The survey found that the proportion of those who reported they had ever had sex, had begun having sex before age 13, had engaged in sex within the last three months and had sex with at least four partners all increased slightly between 2005 and 2007.

None of the increases were sufficient to convince statisticians that there is a real upward trend. But when the agency analyzed the numbers for The Post, statisticians found that every measure of sexual activity passed the statistical test for having leveled off between 2001 and 2007 and the condom use numbers passed the test for leveling off beginning in 2003.

"The longer any trend exists, the more confident we can be in it," said Laura K. Kann, who heads the project at the CDC.

Because the survey involved only teens who are still in school, they might underestimate the level of sexual activity and overestimate condom use, several experts said. And the fact that there were slight increases in the sexual activity numbers and a decrease in condom use raised fears those trends might continue when the next round of data is collected in 2009.

"What's really important here is we're really running out of steam," Wechsler said. "There's no reason for panic, but there is reason for concern that we're not making the progress we were making before."

TITLE: Obama Resigns From Church


TEXT:

Barack Obama Obama Resigns Church Membership
Updated 8:02 p.m. By Keith Richburg ABERDEEN, S.D. -- Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, resigned their membership in the South Side Chicago church that had been their spiritual home for two decades, but that recently become a political liability in Obama's campaign for the presidency, according to aides.
The resignation came in a letter Obama sent to Trinity United Church of Christ's Rev. Otis Moss on Friday, saying, "We are writing to make official our decision to end our membership at Trinity."
"We make this decision with sadness. Trinity was where I found Christ, where we were married and where our children were baptized," the letter said. 
"But as you know, our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own view."
Obama's unexpected decision comes after a second controversy involving incendiary remarks from a pastor at the Trinity United Church of Christ, this time the Roman Catholic Rev. Michael Pfleger, who sharply ridiculed Sen. Hillary Clinton in a sermon last Sunday.
Obama scheduled an unplanned news conference Saturday evening here in Aberdeen, after news of the resignation began to spread.
Just a few weeks ago, Obama was forced to distance himself from his pastor of two decades, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, after videotapes surfaced of Wright making critical comments about the United States and suggesting AIDS was a U.S. government plot against blacks.
Wright had introduced Obama to Christianity, and one of Wright's sermons was the inspiration for Obama's book title, "The Audacity of Hope." Comments

TITLE: Cathedral in Fiscal Squeeze

These are tough times at Washington National Cathedral .





Facing financial difficulties, the 100-year-old institution recently laid off 33 people, including clergy -- its first layoff in decades -- as it struggles to balance its budget. It is suspending programs, asking some remaining staffers to double up on duties and closing its popular greenhouse, a move that has stirred community anger.

"We're in a phase of significant tightening," said the Very Rev. Samuel Lloyd III, who took the helm of the Episcopal cathedral as dean in 2005. He said the severity of the budget shortfall caught leaders by surprise. "We didn't expect that we would have to do what we have done."

Soon-to-be former employees say they are devastated. "It came out of nowhere," said greenhouse employee Patricia Downey, her voice wobbly with emotion. "It's been hard."

The nationally known landmark, whose Gothic towers can be seen for miles from its site in Northwest Washington, is a popular destination that is expected to attract about 500,000 visitors this fiscal year. It also has been the site of high-profile memorial services and funerals, such as those for three presidents: Dwight Eisenhower , Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford .

Cathedral leaders say an ambitious expansion launched by Lloyd to broaden the cathedral's mission, funded mostly by a $7 million bequest that runs out next year, is forcing them to make some tough choices.

Donations, though increasing, have not climbed enough to make up for the loss of the bequest money. At the same time, the cathedral's endowment is declining because of the struggling financial markets. The cathedral uses proceeds from the endowment -- which sources say stood at $70 million before declining recently -- to fund a portion of its budget.

Laid-off employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing their severance pay, are critical of the leadership of Lloyd and the cathedral's governing body. They say cathedral leaders ought to have seen the financial crunch coming.

"They should have seen the writing on the wall," said one former employee. "It's very disheartening to see some of the things happening."

But Lloyd defended his leadership, saying revenue did not climb as quickly as expected and the economic slowdown hurt the cathedral's investments.

"We knew that we were going to come off it," Lloyd said, referring to the bequest. "We had hoped that the economy would be doing robustly and we wouldn't have to have the kind of bump that we're having."

Under Lloyd's leadership, the cathedral's budget has increased 26 percent since 2006 to a projected $26 million for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. Cathedral leaders say the increase was largely because of the bequest, which was spread out over three years. In the next fiscal year, however, the budget will drop to $24 million.

TITLE: Cardiac Response Lags in D.C.


TEXT:






By Elissa Silverman
Washington Post Staff Writer

Thursday, May 29, 2008;
Page A01





Only one in eight cardiac arrest patients transported by District ambulances make it to an emergency room with a pulse. Across the river in Arlington County and Alexandria, the rate is twice as high.



Patients in cardiac arrest, a condition usually triggered by an electrical disorder that disrupts the heart's blood-pumping, make up less than 1 percent of the District's 911 calls. That was 585 patients in 2005, the last year for which statistics are available. But experts say success in keeping those patients alive is one of the most telling indicators of the overall quality of an emergency medical system.

The number of cardiac arrest patients who are discharged and are able to resume their old lives is unknown because the hospitals do not provide that patient data to the District.

The District, at 61 square miles, would seem to have an advantage over more sprawling suburban counties in response time for patients in cardiac arrest. But its rate matches that of Prince George's County , which is 485 square miles and is growing so fast that officials are scrambling to provide more ambulance services. Arlington and Alexandria, jurisdictions similar to the District in density, lead the area in getting the patients to the hospital alive. Montgomery and Fairfax counties had rates of about one in six. Chances of survival increase in all jurisdictions when cardiac arrest is witnessed.

Although officials say the District is meeting a national standard of getting advanced life support units to critical cases within eight minutes 90 percent of the time, that's often too long. The likelihood of survival falls each minute patients in cardiac arrest go without treatment.

In 2005, only 12 percent, or 69, of the cardiac arrest patients treated by D.C. emergency medical personnel reached the hospital with a pulse, or in technical terms, a "return of spontaneous circulation." The numbers do not include those in cardiac arrest because of trauma.

"It's a clear indicator that the system in the District is not performing up to the [de facto national] standard of care," said Gregg C. Lord, associate director of the National Emergency Medical Services Preparedness Initiative at George Washington University . "If you improve cardiac arrest survival rates," then the EMS system will have been improved.

There is no national average for cardiac arrest survival, and not all jurisdictions calculate rates using the same method, Lord said. But no matter how you do the math, the District's percentage is low, he said.

In addition to response time, boosting rates depends on factors such as public access to defibrillators and people's willingness to help a stranger in distress, according to experts.

Michael Williams , chief medical officer for D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services, said that the District's rate is "too low" and that he has plans to boost the numbers, including training all D.C. government workers in CPR. But he said those plans are contingent on his department receiving supplemental funding. That money, which was approved by the D.C. Council this month but has not been disbursed, is also needed to address other shortcomings in the District's approach to emergency care.

Some are long-standing problems, despite efforts to remedy them.

For example, morphine and Valium , drugs commonly given to patients experiencing symptoms of a heart attack or seizure, respectively, are not stocked on District ambulances though they were approved for such use in 2002. Williams said he wants to use part of the designated $3.7 million to purchase the drugs.

TITLE: Stung at Pumps, More Hop a Bus

Transit systems that ferry commuters into Washington from outlying regions are experiencing significant ridership increases as some gas prices pass $4 a gallon, and Metro officials caution that trains could be overwhelmed if prices go even higher.



Officials are looking for ways to buy or lease more buses, expand parking, encourage employers to stagger work schedules and persuade current riders to avoid the peak of the morning rush period.

In Loudoun County , ridership on county-run commuter buses jumped 23 percent in April from April 2007. Officials scrambled to put additional buses into service, two months ahead of schedule.

In Maryland, ridership on the 15 commuter bus routes into Washington increased 15 percent in April, double the rate of increase from last fall, state transportation officials said. On Wednesday, state officials approved $3.3 million to expand bus service on nine of those routes.

Metro, which at 1.2 million subway and bus trips on an average weekday is the area's largest transit provider, is working on a contingency plan to help itself -- and the region -- prepare for a huge shift to public transit should gas prices hit $5 a gallon. Despite fare and fee increases in January, Metro's average weekday ridership in April -- 771,811 -- was slightly more than 4 percent above that in April 2007.

"There is a point at which we may see a massive move of commuters from driving to transit because of cost," General Manager John B. Catoe Jr. told board members last week.

Metro is urging regional officials to discuss options, even though they might not involve Metrorail. Local transportation departments could run bus-only lanes. Large employers, including the federal government, with a workforce of 300,000 in the Baltimore-Washington area, could institute mandatory flextime. Subway riders could shift their commute so they are not riding at the height of the morning rush, when trains arrive at downtown stations between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m.

"We're not always going to have the solutions," said Nat Bottigheimer, Metro's chief planner. "We're trying to give examples of the kinds of things that can be done so people will be comfortable taking a leap of faith to change a habit."

Transit officials say rising gas prices will most affect solo drivers with the longest commutes, many of whom are considering carpools and vanpools.

On the regional Commuter Connections bulletin board on the Web, ride-sharing postings from Fairfax County and Loudoun increased 87.5 percent in the first quarter of the year from the same period last year.

Sandy Silzer of Sterling, who drives an 11-person vanpool to Northwest Washington, has a waiting list of half a dozen. She is considering upgrading from a 12-person van to one that seats 15. The high gas prices are also having an effect on what she charges: She might soon have to raise her fee of $180 a month if prices keep going up, she said.

"Lately, I've been filling it when I get to half a tank, because I've been trying to edge the prices. They've been going up so frequently," said Silzer, who has a government job in the District.









Bill Powers of Burke, a program manager with the Department of Homeland Security , started looking for transportation alternatives when he began spending $200 a week to gas up his Jeep Commander back in March, up from about $125 in November. He always enjoyed the flexibility of having his own ride, enough even to forgo the transit subsidy his employer offered.



He began calling vanpools and soon realized that he wasn't alone: He called six before finding an opening.

"I finally struck gold about two or three weeks ago," said Powers, who now hops into a van with 14 others about a mile from home at 6:05 a.m. He's at his office building in Northwest Washington by 6:45 a.m.

For people who are not regular transit users, the first hurdle is the biggest. But across the country, enough people are taking that step to increase transit ridership nationwide, said Rob Padgette, director of policy, development and research at the American Public Transportation Association, an industry group. "We haven't seen anything like this in a long time," he said.

Gas prices probably have much to do with that increase, but there is little research that shows a direct correlation.

During the 1970s oil crisis, gasoline shortages pushed national transit ridership up -- 6.7 percent in 1979 over the previous year and 5.4 percent in 1980. By comparison, ridership grew 2.1 percent in 2007, but that was the highest level in 50 years.

Padgette predicts that the number will rise, particularly for rail, because those trips are the longest.

"We're going to see some pretty striking numbers this year, and they will show up later this year if fuel prices remain high," he said.

On Friday, the Transportation Department reported that in March, Americans drove 11 billion fewer miles than in March 2007, a 4.3 percent drop and the first time in nearly three decades that traffic has dropped between one March and the next.

For some local officials, the link between skyrocketing gas prices and the jump in public transportation rides is clear.

Loudoun officials are scrambling to put more commuter buses on the road for the two-hour trips between remote parts of the county and downtown Washington. Average daily ridership in April was 3,281, but already this month, some days have exceeded 4,000 riders, county transit chief Nancy Gourley said.

She said the agency might need to lease more buses, consider running feeder buses to take commuters to transit centers and expand parking at a 750-space lot.









Ridership on Virginia Railway Express, which runs trains from Manassas and Fredericksburg to Union Station , is also increasing, jumping nearly 12 percent in April, according to spokesman Mark Roeber.



In anticipation of high demand this fall, VRE is adding five rail cars each month until October, when it will have 106 cars, up from 78, he said. That will mean 4,000 more seats. April's average weekday ridership was 15,312.

MARC ridership increased 6 percent in March over the previous year and trains are at capacity, according to a spokeswoman for the Maryland Transit Administration , which operates the Penn, Camden and Brunswick lines. Average weekday ridership in March was 31,943.

Some drivers made the switch to public transit months ago, when gas seemed expensive at $3 a gallon.

Paul Fickinger, who commutes between Severna Park and Chevy Chase , took a combination of the MARC train and Metrorail two or three days a week last summer instead of driving. Now it's more like four days, sometimes five.

"The tipping point was probably when [gas prices] hit $3," said Fickinger, head of property management at a real estate company.

Aletha Randolph also drove when she began her job in Crystal City three years ago. But the cost of commuting across the Potomac River from Cheverly grew too high. She started riding Metro in January.

"It takes a little bit more time, but as far as saving money . . . now, instead of filling up my car every week, week and a half, I now fill it up close to every three weeks," she said.

This month, weekday Metro ridership during peak periods was 509,533 trips.

If riders spread out their rush-hour trips, instead of crowding into the "peak of the peak," Metro could accommodate an additional 140,000 trips on the subway, Metro's Bottigheimer said.

One of the biggest obstacles to spreading out ridership is space at parking lots, which fill up quickly at suburban stations near the ends of the lines. One option, Bottigheimer said, would be to set aside spaces for carpoolers.

Philip Westcott of New Market, a transportation engineer, is an expert on how to get from point A to point B. But he still hasn't found a good rail or bus option for his commute to Baltimore. So he has had to suck it up at the pump, paying $60 to fill the tank of his Nissan Xterra. That lasts for four days of commuting.

If it gets much worse, he said, he and his wife will have to join carpools. "If gas prices get above $4.50 or something, that's the only option we have, really," he said.

Staff writers Mark Berman and Jennifer Buske and researcher Meg Smith contributed to this report.

TITLE: Terror Suspects Appear in Court 


TEXT:






By Josh White
Washington Post Staff Writer

Thursday, June 5, 2008; 10:02 AM





GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, June 5 -- Khalid Sheik Mohammed and four other alleged top al-Qaeda operatives emerged Thursday morning from the shadows of lengthy U.S. detention,appearing publicly for the first time since their captures to face arraignment in one of the most anticipated trials in U.S. history.



The men are alleged to be at the heart of the terror conspiracy that shook America on Sept. 11, 2001 -- unprecedented attacks that fixed al-Qaeda as the nation's chief worldwide enemy. They are charged with orchestrating the deaths of thousands of Americans on airplanes, in New York skyscrapers and at the Pentagon.

Mohammed, a self-proclaimed al-Qaeda commander and alleged mastermind of the terror strike, appeared in the military courtroom with four other defendants, according to wire service accounts of the proceedings. They sat with their lawyers at defense tables as the presiding judge, Marine Col. Ralph Kohlmann, entered the courtroom. The defendants wore white caps and tunics.

Thursday's arraignment is just the first step in what is certain to be a lengthy and contentious legal process, one that likely will put the untested military commissions system itself on trial. Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann, the chief legal adviser for the military commissions, argued Wednesday that the trials will be "fair, just and transparent," but defense lawyers have said that the system is a sham and that justice cannot be pursued in the courtrooms of this island military base.

Though other military commissions cases have reached the stage of arraignment and legal motions, only one other case has been fully adjudicated. That occurred last year when Australian David M. Hicks reached a politically brokered plea agreement and was shortly repatriated and later released.

Thursday's arraignment marks the beginning of what could be the most important and most watched terror prosecution for the U.S. government. The charges carry potential death penalties for all five defendants.

The defendants are expected to have the charges explained to them and to be advised of their rights to counsel. Each has a team of military and civilian lawyers available to them, and they could enter pleas to the charges. Several other detainees have chosen previously to boycott these and similar military commission proceedings.

The detainees have been housed in a row of five tiny cream-colored holding cells at the Expeditionary Legal Complex, 40 paces from the courtroom down a wide concrete walk surrounded by black mesh netting and enormous coils of concertina wire. A set of heavy black double doors give way to a cavernous 4,800-square-foot, gray-carpeted courtroom, its white walls bare except for the armed services' round medallions and a large American flag affixed behind the judge's bench.

The detainees have seats at the far left corner of rectangular defense tables, straight-backed, leather-upholstered chairs closest to the courtroom's left wall. Short chains emerge from holes in the floor where detainees can be shackled should a judge order them restrained. The tables, arranged in a row from the front to the back of the courtroom, lead to a plexiglass window behind which observers sit in a soundproof room.

Military officials escorted nearly 60 members of the domestic and international media to Guantanamo for the hearing this week, and as many as 29 will be allowed into the observation room at a time. But the victims of the defendant's alleged handiwork, and their relatives, will be notably absent from the proceedings Thursday; they were given no option to view or attend .

"That was a mistake," Hartmann said. "We'll make sure that doesn't happen again."

Also glaringly absent from the courtroom will be Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda's fugitive leader, who is mentioned 18 times in the 23-page conspiracy charge sheets but has evaded global efforts to capture or kill him.

TITLE: New Interrogation Probe Sought


TEXT:






By Joby Warrick
Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, June 7, 2008; 3:04 PM





Nearly 60 House Democrats yesterday urged the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to examine whether top Bush administration officials may have committed crimes in authorizing the use of harsh interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists.





In a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , the lawmakers cited what they said was "mounting evidence" that senior officials personally sanctioned the use of waterboarding and other aggressive tactics against detainees in U.S.-run prisons overseas. An independent investigation is needed to determine whether such actions violated U.S or international law, the letter stated.

"This [new] information indicates that the Bush administration may have systematically implemented, from the top down, detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law," it said. The letter was signed by 59 House Democrats, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-Mich.) and House Intelligence Committee members Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-NY).

The request was prompted in part by new disclosures of high-level discussions within the Bush administration that reportedly focued on specific interrogation practices. Some of the new detail was contained in a report last month by the Justice Department's Inspector General, which described a series of White House meetings in which the controversial tactics were vigorously debated.

Conyers, whose committee already is looking into the role played by administration lawyers in authorizing aggressive measures, said a broader probe was now needed.

"We need an impartial criminal investigation," said Conyers, who called the detainee controversy "a truly shameful episode" in U.S. history. "Because these apparent 'enhanced interrogation techniques' were used under cover of Justice Department legal opinions, the need for an outside special prosecutor is obvious."

Justice officials had not yet studied the letter and would not comment, said Peter Carr , a department spokesman. "The Department reviews every letter received by Congress and responds appropriately," he said.

The House letter suggested a broad inquiry that would examine the consequences of administration decisions at U.S. detention sites in Iraq; at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba ; and in former secret prisons operated by the CIA. It said interrogation policies had resulted in "abuse, sexual exploitation and torture" that may have violated the U.S. War-Crimes Act and Anti-Torture Act.

"Despite the seriousness of the evidence, the Justice Department has brought prosecution against only one civilian for an interrogation-related crime," the letter states. "Given that record, we believe it is necessary to appoint a special counsel in order to ensure that a thorough and impartial investigation occurs."

Numerous human-rights groups have been calling for such an investigation for several years. Jennifer Daskal, senior counterterrorism counsel for the group Human Rights Watch , said the request by House members would be significant even if the request for a special counsel is refused.

"The fact that so many representatives have called for the investigation helps lay the groundwork for the inevitable reckoning and accounting that the next administration is going to have to do regarding this administration's practices," Daskal said.

TITLE: Ex-Spokesman: Bush Misled Public on Iraq


TEXT:






By Michael D. Shear
Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, May 28, 2008;
Page A01





Former White House press secretary Scott McClellan writes in a new memoir that the Iraq war was sold to the American people with a sophisticated "political propaganda campaign" led by President Bush and aimed at "manipulating sources of public opinion" and "downplaying the major reason for going to war."



McClellan includes the charges in a 341-page book, "What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception," that delivers a harsh look at the White House and the man he served for close to a decade. He describes Bush as demonstrating a "lack of inquisitiveness," says the White House operated in "permanent campaign" mode, and admits to having been deceived by some in the president's inner circle about the leak of a CIA operative's name.

The book, coming from a man who was a tight-lipped defender of administration aides and policy, is certain to give fuel to critics of the administration, and McClellan has harsh words for many of his past colleagues. He accuses former White House adviser Karl Rove of misleading him about his role in the CIA case. He describes Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as being deft at deflecting blame, and he calls Vice President Cheney "the magic man" who steered policy behind the scenes while leaving no fingerprints.

McClellan stops short of saying that Bush purposely lied about his reasons for invading Iraq, writing that he and his subordinates were not "employing out-and-out deception" to make their case for war in 2002.

But in a chapter titled "Selling the War," he alleges that the administration repeatedly shaded the truth and that Bush "managed the crisis in a way that almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option."

"Over that summer of 2002," he writes, "top Bush aides had outlined a strategy for carefully orchestrating the coming campaign to aggressively sell the war. . . . In the permanent campaign era, it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the president's advantage."

McClellan, once a staunch defender of the war from the podium, comes to a stark conclusion, writing, "What I do know is that war should only be waged when necessary, and the Iraq war was not necessary."

McClellan resigned from the White House on April 19, 2006, after nearly three years as Bush's press secretary. The departure was part of a shake-up engineered by new Chief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten that also resulted in Rove surrendering his policy-management duties.

A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on the book, some contents of which were first disclosed by Politico.com . The Washington Post acquired a copy of the book yesterday, in advance of its official release Monday.

Responding to a request for comment, McClellan wrote in an e-mail: "Like many Americans, I am concerned about the poisonous atmosphere in Washington. I wanted to take readers inside the White House and provide them an open and honest look at how things went off course and what can be learned from it. Hopefully in some small way it will contribute to changing Washington for the better and move us beyond the hyper-partisan environment that has permeated Washington over the past 15 years."

The criticism of Bush in the book is striking, given that it comes from a man who followed him to Washington from Texas.

Bush is depicted as an out-of-touch leader, operating in a political bubble, who has stubbornly refused to admit mistakes. McClellan defends the president's intellect -- "Bush is plenty smart enough to be president," he writes -- but casts him as unwilling or unable to be reflective about his job.









"A more self-confident executive would be willing to acknowledge failure, to trust people's ability to forgive those who seek redemption for mistakes and show a readiness to change," he writes.



In another section, McClellan describes Bush as able to convince himself of his own spin and relates a phone call he overheard Bush having during the 2000 campaign, in which he said he could not remember whether he had used cocaine. "I remember thinking to myself, 'How can that be?' " he writes.

The former aide describes Bush as a willing participant in treating his presidency as a permanent political campaign, run in large part by his top political adviser, Rove.

"The president had promised himself that he would accomplish what his father had failed to do by winning a second term in office," he writes. "And that meant operating continually in campaign mode: never explaining, never apologizing, never retreating. Unfortunately, that strategy also had less justifiable repercussions: never reflecting, never reconsidering, never compromising. Especially not where Iraq was concerned."

McClellan has some kind words for Bush, calling him "a man of personal charm, wit and enormous political skill." He writes that the president "did not consciously set out to engage in these destructive practices. But like others before him, he chose to play the Washington game the way he found it, rather than changing the culture as he vowed to do at the outset of his campaign for the presidency."

McClellan charges that the campaign-style focus affected Bush's entire presidency. The ill-fated Air Force One flyover of New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina struck the city, was conceived of by Rove, who was "thinking about the political perceptions" but ended up making Bush look "out of touch," he writes.

He says the White House's reaction to Katrina was more than just a public relations disaster, calling it "a failure of imagination and initiative" and the result of an administration that "let events control us." He adds: "It was a costly blunder."

McClellan admits to letting himself be deceived about the unmasking of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson, which resulted in his relentless pounding by the White House press corps over the activities of Rove and of Cheney aide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby in the matter.

"I could feel something fall out of me into the abyss as each reporter took a turn whacking me," he writes of the withering criticism he received as the story played out. "It was my reputation crumbling away, bit by bit." He also suggests that Rove and Libby may have worked behind closed doors to coordinate their stories about the Plame leak. Late last year, McClellan's publisher released an excerpt of the book that suggested Bush had knowledge of the leak, something that won McClellan no friends in the administration.

As McClellan departed the White House, he said: "Change can be helpful, and this is a good time and good position to help bring about change. I am ready to move on."

He choked up as he told Bush on the South Lawn, "I have given it my all, sir, and I have given you my all."

Bush responded at the time: "He handled his assignments with class, integrity. He really represents the best of his family, our state and our country. It's going to be hard to replace Scott."

TITLE: For Superdelegates, 'Huge Relief'


TEXT:






By Eli Saslow
Washington Post Staff Writer

Tuesday, June 3, 2008;
Page A04





The novelty of famous suitors and media interviews long ago eroded into exhaustion, and now state Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter of South Carolina is just plain sick of all this. An undecided superdelegate to the Democratic National Convention in August, she opens her e-mail inbox each morning and deletes a handful of threatening notes sent by strangers. Campaign followers call her incessantly. She struggles to find time to run her own campaign for reelection.





Like many of the other 150 or so superdelegates who remain uncommitted, Cobb-Hunter vowed early on to decide between Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) and Barack Obama (Ill.) only after every state had its chance to vote. Her wait ends tonight, after Montana and South Dakota hold the final Democratic primaries.

"Honestly, it's going to be over with and it's going to be a huge relief," Cobb-Hunter said. "The candidate is going to be such an obvious choice after the end of the primaries that nobody will care one way or another if I commit or not, and that's just great."

The party will send 796 superdelegates to the convention in Denver, and most of them have already committed to Obama. The ones who haven't committed to him or to Clinton have various reasons.

Some members of Congress are concerned about offending constituents who support the other candidate. Coloradans may think they should remain neutral because they will host the convention. Then there are leading party officials, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean , who have presented themselves as honest brokers in the nomination process.

Several superdelegates contacted yesterday said they spent the past six months waiting, sometimes impatiently, for voters to reach a consensus before expressing opinions of their own.

Richard Ray, president of the Georgia AFL-CIO, did not want his views to affect other voters because "the truth is, I'm not any smarter than anybody else." Gray Sasser, chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party, felt awkward speaking for his party before one candidate emerged as a clear-cut favorite.

But after today's primaries, the uncommitted superdelegates acknowledge they will have nothing much to wait for. With the primary season behind them and a final ruling delivered on the fate of the Florida and Michigan delegations, they have all the information they need -- and much of it points to Obama.

"The vast majority of state party chairs have remained neutral throughout this process to wait and see what people decide, and it looks like they've pretty much decided," Sasser said. "I don't want to wait until August to announce who I'm supporting, and I don't think many people do. This is a matter of getting the party unified behind one candidate. Tuesday represents the last data points we are going to collect, and the moment of decision is drawing close for all of us."

Many of the superdelegates agreed that waiting, not deciding, has proved their greatest challenge. As the primary season extended through the spring, they found themselves at the center of the whirlwind, with their neutrality constantly scrutinized by officials in the two campaigns, bloggers, ardent supporters of Clinton or Obama, and in some instances the candidates themselves.

Belkis Leong-Hong, from Maryland, took interview calls from news outlets in China and Germany. Yolanda Wheat, from Missouri, stopped granting interviews. "It's too much," she said.

"You hear people accuse us undecideds of playing coy, like we're waiting for the right moment and then trying to get some big position in Washington," Ray said. "But if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. I could have done the easy thing: commit to Obama after he did well in Georgia. But I'm making sure, in my own mind and in my own heart, that if I cast that one little vote that I'm responsible for, I'm doing the right thing."

Cobb-Hunter said: "It would have been easy to be done and decided with all this a long time ago. But now I'm feeling better, because I've let the people have their say and it's all going to be over pretty soon."

TITLE: Child Obesity May Have Peaked


TEXT:






By Rob Stein
Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, May 28, 2008;
Page A03





The obesity epidemic may have peaked among U.S. children, halting a decades-long trend of inexorably expanding waistlines among the nation's youngest and most vulnerable, federal health officials reported yesterday.





A new analysis of the most recent data collected by an ongoing government survey, considered the most authoritative on the subject, detected the first sign since the 1980s that the proportion of 2-to-19-year-olds who are overweight may have stopped rising, the National Center for Health Statistics reported.

"It looks like it's leveling off," said Cynthia L. Ogden, an epidemiologist whose analysis is being published in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . "It could finally be stabilizing."

More data will be needed, however, to confirm that the data represent a turnaround in the long upward trend and not just a temporary pause, Odgen noted. And even if the epidemic has peaked, the pace at which young people are becoming overweight remains alarmingly high. Moreover, those who are already overweight face a future fraught with possible serious health problems.

"It's too soon to uncork the champagne," said David S. Ludwig, an expert on childhood obesity at Children's Hospital Boston who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new research. "We're not out of the woods by any stretch. Even if the rates don't go up any more, they are so high that the full impact of the childhood obesity epidemic will continue for the next few decades."

Still, several experts said the data offer the first glimmer of hope that the country could be starting to push back against a major public health threat.

"We may be turning a corner with respect to obesity," said William H. Dietz, director of the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Dietz noted that the data are consistent with earlier numbers about adults nationwide and with data on children from a handful of states. "I'm hopeful we're at a turning point," he said.

The analysis could not determine why the rate may have stalled, but experts said it could be because of a variety of factors, including rising awareness of the problem among parents, schools, community groups, and government and privately funded programs.

"This lets us know that the epidemic is not an unstoppable epidemic and gives us hope our collective work can reverse it," said Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, president and chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , a private nonprofit group that helps fund anti-obesity programs. "It tells us that when we all work together -- parents and schools, government, voluntary organizations, industry -- we can make a difference."

The proportion of children who are obese has been rising steadily since about 1980, tripling from about 5 percent to more than 15 percent. Overweight children are prone to a host of serious health problems, including asthma, diabetes and heart disease.

Ogden and her colleagues analyzed data collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative database tracking obesity and other major health issues. The study focused on the most recent data -- height and weight measurements collected from about 8,165 children and adolescents as part of the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 surveys. There was no statistically significant change, the researchers found.

Taken together, the weight of 31.9 percent of the youths held steady at or above the 85th percentile for their age, which is considered overweight; 16.3 percent were at or above the 95th percentile, the definition of obese; and 11.3 percent were at or above the 97th percentile for their age, which classifies them as very obese.









Moreover, when the researchers compared the two periods with surveys dating back to 1999, they found no significant increase over the entire period, strengthening their confidence that the trend had leveled off.





"After two time points it looked pretty much the same, but you need more time points to determine a trend, so it's hard to be sure. But after multiple time points that look flat, you may be cautiously optimistic that it is leveling off," Ogden said.

The trends held steady for males and females and across all racial and ethnic groups, though older children, along with blacks, Hispanics and other minorities, continued to have higher obesity rates.

"I don't want to minimize the problem," Ogden said. "It hasn't gone away. But this may be a first necessary step; it perhaps is starting to go down."

Experts offered a variety of possible explanations for the shift.

"I don't think we can pinpoint to any one thing that is responsible for the plateau, but I think it could be a gathering of a variety of strategies," Dietz said.

Barry M. Popkin, who heads the Interdisciplinary Obesity Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , said he is skeptical that government programs are responsible. One possible influence, he said, is the flagging economy.

"When economic times are difficult, we always slow things down on lots of things, like eating," Popkin said.

Another possibility is that there is a limit to how many children are genetically predisposed to becoming obese, and they have already become so.

"It may be that we've reached a point where the proportion of the population genetically susceptible to obesity is already obese," said Susan Yanovski, co-director of the office of obesity research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Some researchers, however, are skeptical that the epidemic has peaked.

"The government definitely wants us to believe we're making progress in the obesity epidemic. We on the ground feel that's ridiculous," said Robert H. Lustig, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of California at San Francisco . "We who are taking care of patients are seeing bigger and bigger problems."

Not only are doctors continuing to see more overweight children, but the proportion who are severely overweight appears to be increasing, several experts said.

"More and more children are overweight, and those coming in are much heavier than they were," said Melinda S. Sothern of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans.

TITLE: Climate Changes Harming U.S.


TEXT:






By Juliet Eilperin
Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, May 28, 2008;
Page A02





Global warming is already affecting the nation's forests, water resources, farmland and wildlife, and will have serious negative consequences over the next 25 to 50 years, according to a report issued yesterday by the federal government.





The scientific assessment by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, which was commissioned by the Agriculture Department and carried out by 38 scientists inside and outside the government, provides the most detailed look in nearly eight years at how climate change is reshaping the American landscape. The report, which runs 193 pages and synthesizes a thousand scientific papers, highlights how human-generated carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels have already translated into more frequent forest fires, reduced snowpack and increased drought, especially in the West.

Anthony C. Janetos, director of the Joint Global Change Research Institute of the University of Maryland and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , said the document aims to inform federal resource managers and dispel the public's perception that global warming will not be felt until years from now.

"They imagine all these ecological impacts are in some distant future," said Janetos, one of the lead authors, who noted that many animals and plants have shifted their migratory and blooming patterns to reflect recent changes in temperature. "They're not in some distant future. We're experiencing them now."

The document concludes that Americans must face the fact that many of these changes are locked in even if the country takes significant steps to cut emissions in the coming decades.

"Climate change is currently impacting the nation's ecosystems and services in significant ways, and those alterations are very likely to accelerate in the future, in some cases dramatically," the report says. "Even under the most optimistic CO2emission scenarios, important changes in sea level, regional and super-regional temperatures and precipitation patterns will have profound effects."

Richard Moss, vice president and managing director for climate change at the advocacy group World Wildlife Fund , said in an interview that the report represents "the very first upfront acknowledgment from the administration that we are already experiencing climate change impacts."

As recently as July 2007, the administration submitted a report to the United Nations that omitted any discussion of how global warming will affect wildfires, heat waves, agriculture or snowpack.

Moss, who led the U.S. Climate Change Science Program coordination office during both the Clinton and Bush administrations, praised the program for producing the analysis, which is part of a long-delayed series of official climate reports. "At the same time," he added, "we all need to be looking at how the administration now intends to use the results of this information, because it really is worrisome."

The researchers said that of 1,598 animal species examined in more than 800 studies, nearly 60 percent were found to have been affected by climate change.

In addition, the number and frequency of forest fires and insect outbreaks are "increasing in the interior West, the Southwest, and Alaska," while "precipitation, stream flow, and stream temperatures are increasing in most of the continental United States" and snowpack is declining in the West.

The Agriculture Department, the study's lead sponsor, issued a statement yesterday highlighting some of the report's findings for farmers, noting that the higher temperatures mean that grain and oilseed crops will mature more rapidly but face an increased risk of failure and "will negatively affect livestock."









"The report issued today provides practical information that will help landowners and resource managers make better decisions to address the risks of climate change," said Agriculture Department chief economist Joseph Glauber.





Agriculture Department spokesman William Hohenstein said the department is already incorporating climate change into all of its national forest management plans, and it is drafting a strategic research plan aimed at coping with global warming. "We will use this as a springboard in terms of identifying the questions we're going to focus on" for the strategic plan, he said of the report.

Peter Backlund, another of the report's lead authors and director of research relations at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , said in an interview that the Departments of Agriculture and Interior and other federal agencies will be tested by changing climate conditions on both public and private land.

"This is going to be a big challenge for agencies that haven't traditionally been big players in climate," Backlund said, adding the government's monitoring systems can chart major changes but are insufficient to serve as a climate warning system. "We lack the ability to identify the more subtle changes that are happening that could be much larger in the future. . . . We're pulling this information from systems that weren't designed to look at that."

The report predicts that some of the nation's most valued landscapes may change radically in the near future as precipitation and weather patterns continue to shift.

"Management of Western reservoir systems is very likely to become more challenging as runoff patterns continue to change," it states. "Arid areas are very likely to experience increased erosion and fire risk. In arid ecosystems that have not co-evolved with a fire cycle, the probability of loss of iconic, charismatic megaflora such as Saguaro cacti and Joshua trees will greatly increase."

One of the greatest challenges land managers will face over the next few decades, Janetos said, is uncertainty.

"You can't really assume anymore the climate is going to be familiar or similar to what we've seen over the 20th century," he said. "We're moving into new territory."

TITLE: In Britain, Rape Rarely Punished


TEXT:






By Mary Jordan
Washington Post Foreign Service

Thursday, May 29, 2008;
Page A01





LONDON -- After Linda Davies reported to police that her 15-year-old daughter had been raped, it took three months -- plus two dozen phone calls and a threat of legal action -- before police questioned the suspect, a 28-year-old neighbor.





"I gave police his name, address, mobile phone number, car registration -- everything but his passport," said Davies, 44, a strong-minded mother of two daughters. "I was basically begging them. He lived five minutes away from us."

The suspect was finally arrested but acquitted at a trial in which the judge told the jury that he was "in a way a man of good character" because his previous criminal convictions, for possession of stolen goods and marijuana, did not involve violence.

Davies was furious at the judge, who also instructed the jurors to ignore the victim's young age, and at police, who lost cellphone records that contradicted the defendant's account.

"This has shattered us," Davies said. "We felt like the whole system was against us."

Davies said she was stunned to learn that her daughter's case was the rule, not the exception. According to government statistics, only 5.7 percent of rapes officially recorded by police in England and Wales end in a conviction.

"What are they saying?" Davies asked. "That 95 percent of women that come forward are telling lies?"

In Britain , a nation whose justice system has been used as a model around the globe, government officials and women's rights activists agree that rape goes largely unpunished.

Solicitor General Vera Baird, who oversees criminal prosecutions in England, estimated that 10 to 20 percent of rapes are brought to authorities' attention. According to government figures, 14,000 cases a year are reported and 19 out of 20 defendants walk free.

"There will never be proper female equality and appropriate dignity afforded to one-half of the population if it's possible to rape somebody and get away with it," said Baird, one of the highest-ranking women in the British government.

Thousands of victims each year once chose not to go to police because of shame, women's advocates say. Now, the advocates say, the bigger reason is that rape victims feel the system is stacked against them.

A 2005 report commissioned by the police found a "culture of skepticism" in the justice system when it came to rape cases, and recommended shifting the focus from seeking reasons not to believe the accuser to gathering evidence to support the charge.

TITLE: Senate: Bush Misused Intel


TEXT:






By Randall Mikkelsen
Reuters

Thursday, June 5, 2008; 11:34 AM





WASHINGTON - President George W. Bush and his top policymakers exaggerated Saddam Hussein's links to terrorism and ignored doubts among intelligence agencies about Iraq's arms programs as they made their case for war, a Senate committee reported on Thursday.



The Senate intelligence committee said in a study that major Bush administration statements that Iraq had a partnership with al Qaeda and provided it with weapons training were unsupported by intelligence, and sometimes contradicted it.

It also said statements on Iraq's weapons before the March 2003 U.S.-led invasion were substantiated in most cases by available U.S. intelligence, but that they failed to reflect internal debate over those findings.

The long-delayed Senate study supported previous reports and findings that the administration's main case for war -- that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction -- was inaccurate and deeply flawed.

"The president and his advisors undertook a relentless public campaign in the aftermath of the (September 11, 2001) attacks to use the war against al Qaeda as a justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein," intelligence committee Chairman John Rockefeller said in written commentary on the report.

"Representing to the American people that the two had an operational partnership and posed a single, indistinguishable threat was fundamentally misleading and led the nation to war on false pretenses."

The report also cited at least one statement -- by then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, that the Iraqi government operated underground weapons of mass destruction facilities -- that was not backed up by intelligence information.

REPUBLICAN DISSENT

The committee voted 10-5 to approve the report, with two Republican lawmakers supporting it. Sen. Christopher Bond and three other Republican panel members denounced the study in an attached dissent as a "partisan exercise."

White House spokeswoman Dana Perino cited Republican objections to the report, but said the issue of inaccurate intelligence had been previously aired.

"We had the intelligence that we had, fully vetted, but it was wrong. We certainly regret that and we've taken measures to fix it," Perino said.

U.S. public opinion, supportive of the war at the start, has soured on the war in the last few years, contributing to a dive in Bush's popularity.

TITLE: Crews Find Motorcyclist's Body

By Matt Zapotosky and Howard Schneider
Washington Post Staff Writers

Tuesday, May 27, 2008; 10:07 AM





Authorities this morning identified Nathan Townsend, 22, of Alexandria, as the motorcyclist who swerved from the George Washington Parkway last night and tumbled down a steep embankment toward the Potomac River.



A news release from the U.S. Park Police said that Townsend was a member of the military, but did not provide other details.

A team of officials from several agencies found Townsend's body shortly after 6 a.m. in the dense trees and underbrush lining the riverbank along that portion of the parkway, said U.S. Park Police Sgt. Robert Lachance.

After intermittent closures during a search for Townsend's body, all lanes of the George Washington Parkway were reopened this morning.

A search for the body had been called off shortly before midnight and resumed as the sun came up this morning.

The parkway was closed last night, causing major backups as travelers returned from the long Memorial Day weekend. The southbound lanes were reopened about 12:15 a.m. today.

The search began yesterday evening after Arlington police got a call about 6 p.m. that a motorcyclist, riding alongside another biker, had driven off the cliff and vanished from sight, authorities said. The motorcyclist left the roadway about a mile north of the Spout Run exit, officials said.

Police said last night why the motorcycle swerved off the roadway.

The other motorcyclist stayed on the scene during the search but declined to speak with reporters, said Carol Saulnier, a spokeswoman for the Arlington fire department.

After learning about the accident, police closed the northbound parkway to begin their search. But about 6:45 p.m., a Mercedes SUV traveling southbound on the parkway rolled over and sent a loose tire into the rescue effort.

"That's a huge safety issue for us. It was literally about 25 feet from where the rescue was," Saulnier said.

The driver was taken to a nearby hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening.

The second accident prompted police to shut down the parkway in both directions.

Last night's search included rescuers on foot, searchers using fire department ladder trucks to peer over the embankment, officers in helicopters using night vision equipment to scour the steep and heavily wooded terrain, and others in boats on the Potomac searching the water.

Because of the thick undergrowth and foliage in the area, it took rescuers more than two hours to locate the motorcycle, which officials described as a blue sports bike. Saulnier said the cycle was found about 50 feet beyond the parkway guardrail, on the edge of a 100-foot drop to the river.

"There's very, very heavy underbrush where they are, and then it's like a cliff going down to the water," she said.

A fire department spokesman said that safety concerns related to darkness were a factor in calling off the search for the night.

TITLE: Safety Lapsed in Rush to House Katrina Victims 


TEXT:






By Spencer S. Hsu
Washington Post Staff Writer

Sunday, May 25, 2008;
Page A01





Within days of Hurricane Katrina's landfall in August 2005, frantic officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency ordered nearly $2.7 billion worth of trailers and mobile homes to house the storm's victims, many of them using a single page of specifications.



Just 25 lines spelled out FEMA's requirements, with little mention of the safety of those to be housed. Manufacturers produced trailers with unusual speed. Within months, some residents began complaining about unusual sickness; breathing problems; burning eyes, noses and throats; even deaths.

Today, industry and government experts depict the rushed procurement and construction as key failures that may have triggered a public health catastrophe among the more than 300,000 people, many of them children, who lived in FEMA homes.

Formaldehyde -- an industrial chemical that can cause nasal cancer, may be linked to leukemia, and worsens asthma and respiratory problems -- was present in many of the FEMA housing units in amounts exceeding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's recommended 15-minute exposure limit for workers, the limit at which acute health symptoms begin to appear in sensitive individuals.

Weak government contracting, sloppy private construction, a surge of low-quality wood imports from China and inconsistent regulation all contributed to the crisis, a Washington Post review found. But each of the key players has pointed fingers at others, a chain of blame with a cost that will not be known for years.

Already, 17,000 plaintiffs who lived in FEMA units have alleged damaging health consequences, from respiratory problems to dozens of deaths and cancer cases, in a federal class-action lawsuit naming 64 trailermakers and the federal government. Many of the plaintiffs were drawn from the roughly 350,000 people who unsuccessfully filed claims against the Army Corps of Engineers over the levee breaches that flooded New Orleans.

The CDC reported this month that Hurricane Katrina led to increased complaints of lower-respiratory illnesses among 144 children studied in Mississippi, but it found no difference between those who lived in FEMA housing and those who did not. However, the CDC said the findings could not be generalized beyond the sample, and the agency is conducting a broad, five-year study of the storm's health impact on children across the Gulf Coast area.

"I still can't believe that we bought a billion dollars' worth of product with a 25-line spec. There's not much you can do in 25 lines to protect life safety," said Joseph Hagerman, a Federation of American Scientists expert who is leading a $275 million effort, funded by the Department of Homeland Security , to develop new emergency housing. "There's over 20,000 parts in these homes."

FEMA, for its part, faults manufacturers of the trailers, which are wheeled, and the mobile homes, which usually sit on concrete pads. Some trailermakers used cheaper, substandard wood products in the rush to meet production targets, increasing emissions of the cancer-causing chemical, according to industry officials and analysts.

Companies say that federal guidelines were inconsistent and that they relied on suppliers to deliver quality materials. In turn, wood suppliers blame cheap, high-formaldehyde-emitting plywood imports that flooded the U.S. market during the recent housing boom.

R. David Paulison, who became acting FEMA administrator two weeks after the storm hit the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29, 2005, acknowledged missteps but said changes are needed far beyond his agency. "We're taking all the darn heat. . . . You would think that I ordered them with extra formaldehyde so they didn't rot or something," he said.

"The manufacturers have been skating by on this thing," he said, noting that many trailers bought by FEMA were on sale to consumers. "This is bigger than FEMA. This is bigger than FEMA," he said, repeating for emphasis.









A price has already been paid by trailer residents such as Nicole Esposito, 25, a full-time warehouse worker in Slidell, La. She first noticed her toddler's symptoms after moving into a FEMA trailer in April 2006: an endless series of coughs, colds, sinus infections, earaches and pink, crusty eyes. Treatments and antibiotics had no effect, and soon Alexa, now 4, and later her newborn sister, Alyssa, now 16 months old, regularly needed atomizers to help them breathe.



Last August, doctors said they suspected the cause was exposure to formaldehyde, and told the single mother to leave her trailer at once. "My girls, they could have all these problems the rest of their lives," Esposito said, her voice breaking, ". . . and the doctors still don't know any more."


Hasty Decisions

On Sept. 4, 2005, one week after the storm, Paulison's predecessor, Michael D. Brown, declared that FEMA was "pulling out the stops" to find housing for 237,000 Katrina evacuees who were staying in shelters, the largest internal displacement of Americans since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.

The price of haste was, inevitably, waste. FEMA bought $762 million worth of mobile homes, most of them unusable in coastal flood zones under FEMA rules because they could not be moved quickly in case of another storm. After an intervention by then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), FEMA spent $249 million to lease cruise ship cabins, which evacuees largely refused to use.

FEMA bought 21,300 mobile homes and 33,100 trailers off dealers' lots for $1.4 billion using one page of specifications, according to interviews and documents provided by the agency. It paid manufacturers $931 million to produce an additional 76,800 trailers using eight pages of custom requirements, again with limited safety standards and no mention of formaldehyde.

Paulison said FEMA incorporated applicable federal codes in ordering the mobile homes. Regarding trailers, which are not subject to federal regulation, those sold to the public and to FEMA in the past produced few complaints, he said. "We bought them in good faith, just like we have for the last 20 years."

The largest housing orders were filled by Fleetwood Enterprises and Gulf Stream Coach. FEMA's $520 million order from Gulf Stream, the largest from any builder, exceeded the company's reported 2004 recreational vehicle sales and was its first direct federal contract.

Formaldehyde is a colorless gas present at background levels in nature but emitted from the resins and glues used in many construction components, including particleboard flooring, plywood wall panels, composite wood cabinets and laminated countertops. Emissions are greatest in warm weather and when trailers are newly constructed, the conditions experienced by Katrina victims on the Gulf Coast.

But manufacturers did not discuss, nor did FEMA ask, if it would be safe to house evacuees in trailers for 18 months or more with such materials. "They did not," Paulison said. "I don't think they were asked, either."

A spokeswoman for Fleetwood, based in Riverside, Calif., whose subsidiaries produced 10,600 trailers and 3,000 mobile homes for FEMA, said the company did not discuss the formaldehyde issue with the agency. "You know, when something hasn't been a problem, you often don't suddenly consider that it will be. I don't believe that anybody expected these people to stay in the trailers as long as people have stayed in them," Kathy Munson said.

Fleetwood said its trailers, which were built with only higher-quality, low-emitting wood products that the company said met federal standards for mobile homes, had the lowest levels of formaldehyde, with only 10 percent exceeding the CDC benchmark. Gulf Stream's trailers had the highest levels, with more than 50 percent topping the CDC standard.

Gulf Stream's lawyers said in a letter to congressional investigators that the company mostly met a "longstanding policy" to buy components that comply with mobile home standards, but it acknowledged exceptions. They said the firm "did not conduct any testing on components or parts" but instead "relied on the representations" of its suppliers about their quality.









Brian Delaney, a Gulf Stream spokesman, said he could not respond to questions, citing in part litigation. Among other companies whose trailers tested high in the CDC study, Keystone RV declined to comment. Forest River referred questions to the industry's trade group, the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.



Dave Hoefer Sr., chairman of Pilgrim International, said the pending lawsuits limited what he could say, but he pointed out that FEMA specifications prompted his company to put in fewer sidewall openings than usual, which may have restricted ventilation. He said his company had never received a complaint about formaldehyde and used its usual materials to build Katrina trailers.

An industry association spokesman, Robert Feldman, said symptoms may be caused by mold, Katrina-related chemical spills, smoking or local climate factors. "There may be a rush to conclude formaldehyde is the issue when in fact the results seem to suggest the answer is a little more complex," he said.

However, others said that in 2005 and 2006, much of the nation's hardwood plywood came from Asia and was high in formaldehyde. China's share of the North American market has grown from 4 percent to nearly 40 percent since 2001, according to the Hardwood Plywood & Veneer Association, which represents North American producers.

"The most likely source of formaldehyde in the Katrina trailers and in all travel trailers are composite wood products . . . [and] the most likely source for those materials are imported products," primarily from China, said Elizabeth Whalen, director of corporate sustainability for Columbia Forest Products, of Portland, Ore., the association's largest U.S. plywood manufacturer.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) demanded a U.S. trade investigation after domestic producers complained in 2006 that containers of imported hardwood plywood reeked of formaldehyde, products advertised as having low formaldehyde emissions were falsely labeled and sample tests showed levels much higher than allowed in federal housing.

"There's no real enforcement authority by the government," said Gail Overgard, vice president of Timber Products in Springfield, Ore.


Little Regulation

No binding safety standard exists for formaldehyde in any U.S. homes, even though the chemical was classified as a human carcinogen by the World Health Organization in 2004 and is deemed a probable carcinogen by the U.S. government.

But early this year, the CDC reported that 41 percent of the trailers it tested in December and January had levels of formaldehyde greater than 100 parts per billion, the level that the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends as safe for 15 minutes of exposure by workers.

California health regulators estimate that lifetime exposure to formaldehyde at 100 parts per billion increases cancer risk by 50 cases per 100,000 people.

"Even at levels too low to cause . . . symptoms, there could be an increased risk of cancer," the CDC reported in February. Because the tests were done in winter, they understated exposure levels during warmer months, the agency said.

J. Joe Donaldson, president of the Mississippi chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics , said that "pediatricians along the Gulf Coast . . . all reported epidemic problems with asthma and respiratory symptoms . . . covering the time of the hurricane, and, although it's diminished over time, it's ongoing. I personally believe that formaldehyde did play a significant part in the problem."

Despite its hazards, the chemical's presence in homes has largely escaped regulation. In 1985, after consumer complaints and lawsuits, Washington imposed a limit on the amount of formaldehyde emitted by plywood and particleboard in mobile homes -- but did not restrict how much of that wood can be used.

The Housing and Urban Development office that enforces those rules has a small budget of $6 million and a staff of 13 based only at headquarters. Robert Wilden, who directed the office in the 1980s and 1990s, said in an interview that while the industry "benefits from minimal regulation," it lobbied for cuts in the office's budget.

When HUD set the formaldehyde limit for wood in mobile homes 23 years ago, it said it anticipated that the resulting ambient air levels would be less than 400 parts per billion, or quadruple what the CDC says is problematic. The RV industry association points out that, according to the CDC tests over the winter, levels in 99 percent of the Katrina trailers fell below that threshold.

The use of formaldehyde in trailers is unregulated because they are considered vehicles, not homes, and because their makers say they are typically used a few days at a time, a few times a year.

"The RV industry is generally unregulated, and lobbying efforts have succeeded in keeping it that way," said Connie Gallant, head of the RV Consumer Group, which represents trailer owners.

California regulators recently enacted the nation's tightest formaldehyde limits on wood products, setting limits 60 percent below HUD standards by next year and 75 percent below by 2011. The rules are expected to become a de facto national standard.

FEMA, meanwhile, has barred the future use of trailers, and required that mobile home builders use wood that emits virtually no formaldehyde. The RV industry has embraced HUD and California standards.

FEMA has relocated more than 4,000 families after receiving 11,000 health complaints, but about 22,000 of its trailers remain occupied despite a CDC recommendation that all residents be moved to safer housing. As of May 1, more than 3,000 mobile homes were still occupied.

Paulison said that in the absence of a legally binding safety standard for residential air quality, FEMA will do the best it can in providing disaster housing. But, he complained, "There is no national standard for formaldehyde levels in American homes -- not conventional . . . homes, not [mobile] homes."

Staff researchers Madonna Lebling and Julie Tate contributed to this report.

TITLE: Feds Watch Wall St. From Inside


TEXT:






By Neil Irwin
Washington Post Staff Writer

Tuesday, May 27, 2008;
Page D01





In the two months since the government rescue of Bear Stearns, the Federal Reserve has built on the fly a new system of monitoring investment banks, radically redefining the central bank's role overseeing Wall Street .



New York Fed employees are working inside major investment banks every day, alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission staff members who are the firms' main regulators. The Fed employees are trying to gather information the central bank can use to make sure the billions of dollars it is lending the investment firms, through a special emergency loan program enacted in March, are not being put at undue risk.

This new approach, which is still at a relatively small scale, offers a window into how the nation's system of regulating financial firms might evolve as policymakers sift through the financial wreckage of the past nine months.

The Bush administration has proposed that the Fed become an all-purpose guarantor of the financial system, with the power to poke its head into any company that poses risks -- not just the large commercial banks it now supervises. Congress is likely to consider legislation overhauling financial regulation next year.

"Bear Stearns has forced an issue that we should have been thinking about anyway," said Douglas Elmendorf, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . "The issue isn't just that the Fed did this thing in March. It's that the Fed did what it did in March because investment banks posed risks to the overall financial system and the economy."

But it also creates risks. With the Fed having made emergency funds available to investment banks, lenders and those who work with them might become complacent about risks, expecting a government bailout if anything goes wrong. That could destabilize the financial system further.

"Once the Fed starts investigating and looking at the risks that they're taking, the market could back off and say, 'Well, the Fed's in there, so there can't be much risk,' " said Peter J. Wallison, who studies financial regulation at the American Enterprise Institute .

The Fed currently lacks the legal authority to order investment banks to strengthen risk control systems or change their accounting for exposure to complicated derivatives. The SEC has those powers, though its historical mission has been to ensure that investors are protected, not to protect the integrity of the financial system as a whole.

On March 16, the Fed backed the emergency acquisition of Bear Stearns by putting $30 billion (since changed to $29 billion) in public funds at risk and opened an emergency lending window that last week lent $14.2 billion to investment firms. Both actions, meant to prevent panic from causing a cascade of failures that could have had a catastrophic impact on markets and the world economy, defied 90 years of precedent, insinuating the central bank into the workings of Wall Street as never before.

Fed leaders concluded that they would have to step up their involvement in Wall Street, if only to make sure that those loans were likely to be paid back. So it insisted that banks, in exchange for the new lending, open up about the details of their operations -- a deal that the investment firms readily agreed to.

They have not, however, reached any firm conclusions about what form the ultimate regulation of the financial system ought to take and are not presuming that the improvised system established in the past two months will expand and become permanent once Congress acts.

In the meantime, a special unit has been created in the New York Fed, answering directly to President Timothy F. Geithner. Information about its operations is closely held by Geithner and other senior employees in New York, such that even Federal Reserve governors and presidents of other regional Fed banks know little about what the new unit is doing.









The unit is composed of individuals from the bank supervision staff, whose normal work is to regulate commercial banks; the markets group, which monitors the behavior of all sorts of financial markets watching out for threats to their functioning; and the legal department.



The Fed staffers accompany SEC regulators in frequent visits to the major investment banks Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers . They typically speak to risk managers, auditors, comptrollers and sometimes senior executives.

"What they're doing is not so much regulation, telling the banks what to do, as the Fed is saying, 'I'm lending you money, I'm doing my due diligence,' " said Ernest Patrikis, a partner at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman and a former senior official at the New York Fed.

In the past, collaboration between the Fed and the SEC has been more haphazard. Officials of the two organizations would frequently talk on the phone and meet every few weeks to discuss risks being taken by Wall Street firms, over lunch in the cafeteria at the vault-like headquarters of the New York Fed, for example, or on a balcony there overlooking the narrow streets of lower Manhattan.

As concern grew about the risks taken by hedge funds in 2006, Fed officials and their SEC counterparts had a series of discussions in which each side explained to the other how the institutions they directly supervise -- commercial banks for the Fed and investment banks for the SEC -- measure and manage the risks they are taking by lending to hedge funds.

Now, the interaction is more constant. The SEC is crafting a formal memorandum of understanding that lays out their roles, but it is in an early stage. It will mainly seek to formalize the information-sharing and cooperation that is occurring already, SEC officials have said.

"The collaboration is wide open," said Robert L.D. Colby, deputy director of the SEC's market regulation division. "We're essentially operating as if we're all within one agency. We are telling them what we know and how we think, and they're reflecting back what they know and want to learn. You don't always ask the same questions, and sometimes you get information the other might not have picked up."

TITLE: Police Charge Mugabe Rival


TEXT:






By Craig Timberg
Washington Post Foreign Service

Thursday, June 5, 2008;
Page A10





Zimbabwean police detained opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai for eight hours Wednesday and charged him with violating public order for campaigning ahead of the country's June 27 presidential runoff election, party officials said.



Tsvangirai was traveling between a campaign stop in the western town of Lupane and a rally in nearby Tsholotso when police stopped him at a roadblock shortly after noon, his spokesman George Sibotshiwe said. Tsvangirai was detained for four hours at the roadblock, then for four hours at a police station before he was charged under Zimbabwe's Public Order and Security Act and released. Several other party officials were held with him.

No court date has been scheduled. Charges related to political activity in Zimbabwe are often dropped or quickly dismissed amid scant evidence of wrongdoing.

"It's just an effort to destabilize our campaign program," party spokesman Nelson Chamisa said in Harare, the capital.

Police have severely restricted most forms of political activity since the March 29 vote in which Tsvangirai beat President Robert Mugabe but failed to get the clear majority necessary to claim a first-round victory. Tsvangirai has maintained that he won outright victory but that he was denied power by election officials beholden to Mugabe.

Tsvangirai has been repeatedly arrested, threatened and beaten over the past eight years as Zimbabwe's most prominent opposition leader. He spent seven weeks abroad after the election before returning to campaign in Zimbabwe on May 24.

With the runoff looming, ruling party activists have rampaged across Zimbabwe's countryside in what human rights activists have called the worst political violence and intimidation in two decades. Several dozen opposition party activists have been killed, including at least three attacked in a party office in the southeastern town of Jerera on Tuesday night, witnesses said. Two were injured, and four others are missing.

A witness said more than a dozen men arrived shortly before midnight carrying automatic weapons and singing ruling party songs. After three people in the opposition office were shot to death, the building was set on fire. Jerera, like most of the places where attacks have occurred in recent months, is a former ruling party stronghold where Tsvangirai had a strong showing against Mugabe in the March vote.

By the time Tsvangirai was released Wednesday, darkness had fallen and he did not attend the scheduled rally. Instead, he met with top party officials to determine how to continue campaigning amid increasingly aggressive police tactics.

"They will try to kill, try to assault, try to butcher people, but they won't succeed," Chamisa said.

TITLE: Efforts Fail to Save Oysters


TEXT:






By David A. Fahrenthold
Washington Post Staff Writer

Monday, June 2, 2008;
Page A01





A vast government effort to bring oysters back to the Chesapeake Bay has turned out so dismally that it has the ring of a math-class riddle. How do you spend $58 million to get more of something and wind up with less of it?





Since 1994, state and federal authorities have poured these millions into rejuvenating the famous bivalves and the centuries-old industry that relies on them.

They have succeeded at neither.

Instead, official estimates show there are fewer oysters in the bay and fewer oystermen trying to catch them. If those estimates are accurate, the effort would be a failure of environmental policy that stands out for its scale, even on a bay where policymakers frequently promise big and deliver small.

Scientists and activists say the missteps of the save-the-oyster campaign will have consequences far beyond the half-shell bar. The whole Chesapeake will struggle, they say, missing a species that was as vital to its ecosystem as coral reefs are to theirs.

"You've got fewer oysters and fewer oystermen and fewer oyster-related businesses," when the goal was to help all three, said Robert Glenn of the Coastal Conservation Association of Maryland. "Clearly, your money was not well spent."

Officials who have led these programs defend their work, in part, by pointing to the factors arrayed against them. The bay's dirt chokes oysters. Diseases harmless to human diners kill them by the millions.

In spite of these factors, officials say, they have put millions of oysters in the bay that wouldn't have been there otherwise.

"I wouldn't use the word 'failure.' We obviously have not achieved the restoration response that we had hoped for," said Thomas O'Connell, director of the Maryland state fisheries service. "Every year we have learned to do it better. But there is no oyster restoration [instruction] book out there."

The oyster's plight has been overshadowed this year, with the Chesapeake's blue crab population plummeting. But the bivalve's story is as tragic as any, given that its protagonist just sits still and filters water.

When John Smith explored the Chesapeake in the early 1600s, oysters piled up in reefs that broke the bay's surface. Underneath, they teemed with life.

"There's a mud crab there, another anemone here, another anemone here," said Kennedy Paynter, a University of Maryland professor, watching video of an oyster bed that scientists had constructed in the Patuxent River . He was pointing out creatures that glommed onto or darted among the oysters, forming the vibrant foundation of a food chain that leads up to crabs and rockfish.

TITLE: IAEA: Iran May Be Withholding Information


TEXT:






By GEORGE JAHN
The Associated Press

Monday, May 26, 2008; 3:34 PM





VIENNA, Austria -- Iran may be withholding information needed to establish whether it tried to make nuclear arms, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday in an unusually strongly worded report.



The tone of the language suggesting that Tehran continues to stonewall the agency _ the U.N. nuclear monitor _ revealed a glimpse of the frustration felt by IAEA investigators stymied in their attempts to gain full answers to suspicious aspects of Iran's past nuclear activities.

Iran has described its cooperation with the IAEA probe of its alleged nuclear weapons experiments as positive, suggesting it was providing information requested by agency officials. Indirectly disagreeing, the agency also said that Iran continued to deny such activities, dismissing evidence to the contrary submitted for its perusal as misleading or false.

The findings were part of a restricted agency report forwarded to the U.N. Security Council and to the 35 board members of the International Atomic Energy Agency that was obtained by The Associated Press.

The nine-page report also noted that Tehran remains defiant of U.N. Security Council demands to stop uranium enrichment.

Shrugging off three sets of council sanctions, it had instead expanded its operational centrifuges _ machines that churn out enriched uranium by about 500 since the last IAEA report in February, said the report.

In announcing major progress in Iran's push for nuclear power, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said last month that Iranian scientists were putting 6,000 new uranium enriching centrifuges into place and testing a new type that works five times faster.

The report noted that Iran now had only 3,500 centrifuges and specified that the few advanced machines actually running were only in a testing phase.

Uranium can be used as nuclear fuel or as the fissile core of warheads, depending on the degree of enrichment. Iran insists it has a right to the activity under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and says it want only to generate power.

But addressing whether Iran was complying with agency requests, the report said that "Iran has not provided the Agency with all the information, access to documents and access to individuals necessary to support Iran's statements" that its activities were purely peaceful in intent.

"The Agency is of the view that Iran may have additional information, in particular on high explosives testing and missile related activities which ... Iran should share with the agency," said the report. It was referring to two alleged sets of tests that agency officials say could be linked to a nuclear program.

Iran already rejected evidence provided by the U.S and other IAEA board members on alleged weapons programs in February, but then promised to revisit the issue ahead of the agency's next board meeting in a week.

Its nuclear programs have been under IAEA investigation since 2003, after a dissident group revealed the existence of a clandestine enrichment program.

A senior U.S. envoy suggested the report was a strong indictment of Iran's defiance of the international community's efforts to seek answers about trouble parts of its nuclear program, noting it "details a long list of questions that Iran has failed to answer."

"At the same time that Iran is stonewalling its inspectors, it's moving forward in developing its enrichment capability in violation of security council resolution," Gregory L. Schulte, the chief U.S. delegate to the IAEA told the AP. He described parts of the report as a "direct rebuttal" of Iranian claims that all nuclear questions had been answered.

TITLE: Churches Eye Name Changes


TEXT:






By Brigid Schulte
Washington Post Staff Writer

Sunday, June 8, 2008;
Page C01





The Rev. Todd Thomason looked out at the nearly empty pews of his congregation at Baptist Temple Church last Sunday. He had preached long and hard about Abraham leaving all that he knew and setting out into an unknown future on nothing more than faith in God. He was hoping that, after the service, what was left of his flock would have the courage to do the same.



After 100 years, Baptist Temple, he feared, was dying. In its heyday in the 1950s, more than 900 members crammed into the sanctuary of the pretty white church in Alexandria that was built for 500. Now he was lucky to get 30. Perhaps the problem, he began to think, was the name itself.

"We're probably the most progressive church in the city, but 'Baptist Temple' sounds weird, like it's charismatic and conservative," Thomason said. He worried that the word "Baptist" had become indelibly tied to the political religious right and that when combined with "Temple" it sounded like a fundamentalist "bring out the snakes" kind of place.

So after the service, Thomason would ask the remaining members of the church to save themselves, so to speak, and vote to change their name.

Like those at many Baptist and other Christian churches across the country where attendance has steadily dropped, many Baptist Temple members feel they are at a point where they must either rebrand themselves with a new name, restart as an entirely new church or limp along a few more years before quietly closing their doors.

Recent national surveys show that in an attempt to fill pews, a small but steadily growing number of Christian churches are changing their names and even their religious denominations. Wycoff Baptist in New Jersey became Cornerstone Christian Church. First Baptist in Concord, N.H., is now Centerpoint Church. The Reformed Church in America outside Detroit became Crosswinds Community Church.

Even the Southern Baptist Convention , the largest Protestant group in the country, whose 16 million membership has declined in recent years, has hosted church-naming seminars asking the question, "To Baptist or Not to Baptist?"

"The word Baptist is such a turnoff," said David Roozen, director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research in Connecticut, who has documented the name-changing trend. "There is a kind of national skepticism about evangelical Christianity because of the religious right and the connection to the Bush administration. You say 'Baptist' and people almost automatically think conservative."

Others say it's more about marketing. "We're entering into a nondenominational era," said Roger Oldham, vice president of convention relations for the Southern Baptist Convention. "One hundred years ago, when people moved to a new area, they were looking for the name brand they were accustomed to. Now, people are looking for genuineness and transparency. Not a particular label."

Just up the street from Baptist Temple, Fair-Park Baptist Church, barely hanging on with 30 members, closed its doors a few years ago and reopened as Convergence, with a new mission to cater to area artists, with weekly seminars on "The Artist's Way" and Sunday services at 5 p.m. in deference to musicians playing until the wee hours the night before. Membership dropped to 15 after the change, pastor Lisa Hawkins said, but has inched up to 35.

The Rev. Stephen Welch, executive director of Northstar Church Network, an association of Baptist churches in Northern Virginia, said few new churches have "Baptist" in their names. "I don't think it's a matter of being ashamed, but wanting to position the church where there's less confusion about who you are and who is welcome."

At least that's the argument Thomason made Sunday in the church hall, just before the vote.

TITLE: U.K. Traffic Stops Over Fuel Cost


TEXT:






By Kevin Sullivan and Molly Moore
Washington Post Foreign Service

Wednesday, May 28, 2008;
Page A07





LONDON, May 27 -- Hundreds of truckers shut down a central London highway Tuesday, French fishermen blockaded ports and French President Nicolas Sarkozy proposed cutting European fuel taxes as already high gasoline prices soared even higher.



"It's hard to find words to describe the severity of the problem. It's not even a problem really; it's a meltdown," said Peter Carroll, a trucking industry spokesman who, like hundreds of other drivers, parked his rig on London's A40 highway Tuesday morning, shutting that key commuter artery for most of the day.

The truckers, who eventually delivered a petition to Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's office at 10 Downing Street , were protesting as Britain's national average pump price for diesel hit the equivalent of $9.56 a gallon and regular unleaded hit $8.61 a gallon, according to the Automobile Association.

The protests spreading across Europe signal a growing agitation at skyrocketing fuel prices in nations already accustomed to paying dearly at the pump.

Most European countries long ago chose to heavily tax gasoline, partly to encourage use of public transportation. The British government, for example, charges a $3.77-a-gallon fuel duty and a 17.5 percent consumption tax on top of that -- the highest levels in Europe.

By contrast, U.S. drivers pay an average combined federal and state tax of about 47 cents on a gallon of unleaded and 53.6 cents on a gallon of diesel, according to API, a U.S. trade association.

The current pricing crisis, which has pushed crude oil above $135 a barrel, is pushing even more Europeans out of their cars. The Automobile Association said a recent survey found that 37 percent of its members were using their cars less because of fuel prices.

But for fishermen, taxi drivers, truckers and other people in businesses where using less fuel is not an option, frustration is turning into anger.

"We are being murdered, and you would not walk past a drowning man," said Carroll, speaking after the highway blockade at a protest rally near London's Marble Arch. The drivers are demanding cuts in fuel taxes.

Scores more truckers in Wales formed a two-mile-long line to stage a "go-slow" strike that clogged a main highway. Protest leader Mike Greene told the BBC that if truckers didn't get sharp cuts in the taxes within a week, they would begin blockading refineries and ports.

In 2000, when gas hit about $5 a gallon, truckers, taxi drivers and other protesters nearly paralyzed the country with a week-long blockade of oil refineries and storage depots to stop delivery to gas stations.

In Paris, as furious fishermen continued blockading several French ports, Sarkozy urged the European Union to suspend some of the oil taxes that make European pump prices on average more than double those in the United States.

TITLE: Pentagon Calls for Larger Staff


TEXT:






By Walter Pincus
Washington Post Staff Writer

Sunday, June 1, 2008;
Page A11





The Defense Department 's inspector general says he needs more staff and money to monitor sharply rising spending by the Pentagon on the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the broader fight against terrorism.



While that spending increased by more than 50 percent between fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2007, Inspector General Claude M. Kicklighter's staff has remained relatively constant, according to a report his office sent to Congress on March 31 that was made public last week.

"The rapid growth of the DoD budget since FY 2000 leaves the Department increasingly more vulnerable to the fraud, waste, and, abuse that undermines the Department's mission," the report said.

In seeking an additional $25 million above the Bush administration request for next year's budget, the Kicklighter report said the funds are "directly linked to requests by Congress to increase both audit and investigative efforts regarding Southwest Asia and the Global War on Terror."

The Pentagon budget increased from slightly more than $400 billion in fiscal 2001 to more than $600 billion in fiscal 2007. Over the next seven years, the inspector general wants about a 25 percent increase in his staff, from about 1,500 at present to near 1,900 in 2013, to monitor the spending.

Last week, an inspector general's report to a House committee showed that $1.4 billion in spending between 2001 and 2006 "lacked minimum supporting documentation." For example, it said, a $320 million cash payment by U.S. military officials to an Iraqi ministry had no backup material identifying the ministry or the employees paid.

The Senate Armed Services Committee , which ordered the report last year, has recommended adding $26 million for the inspector general's office in the fiscal 2009 defense authorization bill that is now before Congress.

The report says that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have "forced us to adjust priorities, resulting in gaps in coverage in important areas such as major weapon systems acquisition, wrongdoing by senior officials, whistleblower protection, health care fraud, product substitution and Defense intelligence agencies."

Even with the shifting of assets, the report said that the inspector general at present deploys only two investigative agents for six-month tours in Baghdad, Kuwait City and Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. With additional personnel, Kicklighter could create a field office with a more permanent staff, the reports said.

"The Pentagon's top cop is outgunned, and it's high noon," said Nick Swellenbach of the Project on Government Oversight, the nonprofit watchdog group that released the inspector general's report.

The report said Kicklighter's office is "not able to provide adequate audit coverage of DoD acquisition programs given the dollars expended by the department." It noted that for major weapons contracts that totaled $316 billion in fiscal 2007, resources allowed the auditing of just 58 programs valued at $164 billion.

As Pentagon contracting has increased, the number of auditors in the field has decreased, according to the report. In fiscal 2003, when the total value of Pentagon contracts was about $240 billion, the inspector general had about 180 auditors to review them. In fiscal 2007, when the contracts' value reached more than $300 billion, the number of auditors had dropped to about 150, according to the report.

"Oversight of DoD contracts needs to be strengthened," the report said.

In addition, the number of allegations of wrongdoing by senior Pentagon officials and reprisal complaints received from whistle-blowers has "greatly increased over the past years," the inspector general reported, while the staff in his office available to handle such complaints has "remained static or decreased."

Complaints of reprisals against military whistle-blowers have increased 68 percent in 10 years, from 315 to 528, but staffing to receive the complaints has decreased from 22 to 19, he said.

The report said that "18% of substantiated allegations against senior officials resulted in immediate removal from command, reprimands, reduction in rank and reimbursement to the government."

With 40 full-time employees in the intelligence field, the report said, "we have not been able to perform planned audits and evaluations in key intelligence disciplines." It cited intelligence satellites that gather imagery, electronic and other transmissions and cost billions of dollars to construct and operate.

TITLE: Court: Texas Must Return Polygamous Sect Youths


TEXT:






By David A. Fahrenthold
Washington Post Staff Writer

Thursday, May 29, 2008; 6:17 PM





The Texas Supreme Court ruled this afternoon that state officials should not have removed dozens of children from a polygamist compound in April, agreeing with an appellate court that the group's beliefs were not, by themselves, proof of abuse.



The decision did not immediately release from state custody the 460 children seized from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) compound. But it does seem to indicate that some of them could be going home soon. For the second time in a week, an appeals court has rejected the state's logic for keeping the children, which held that the group's approval of underage marriage put all children at risk of physical or psychological harm.

"On the record before us, removal of the children was not warranted," the court ruled. It found that the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services had taken the children into foster care when less drastic options were available: "the Family Code gives . . . broad authority to protect children short of separating them from their parents."

Today's decision affirms a ruling last week by a Texas court of appeals, which ordered a trial judge in San Angelo, Tex., to reconsider her decision to give the state custody of 41 mothers' children.

The case before the Supreme Court involved state law and, therefore, cannot be appealed to federal court system.

The Supreme Court's decision applies only to those mothers' 139 children, all of whom have been in foster care since the raid on the Eldorado, Tex., compound April 3. But legal experts say that it could be a precedent for releasing many of the other children -- especially boys and prepubescent girls, whom FLDS members consider too young to marry.

The Supreme Court's ruling was a split decision with six of the nine justices voting to affirm the appeals court in its entirety. Three justice upheld portions of the appeals court ruling and dissented on other parts. In the dissenting opinion, Justice Harriet O'Neill contended that the state was within its rights to keep girls who had passed puberty, because the threat to them appeared greatest.

Primaries Florida Voter's Lawsuit Dismissed
By Krissah Williams A federal judge in Tampa has again tossed out a lawsuit filed by a Florida political consultant angry that his vote in the state's Democratic primary will not count. Victor DiMaio's lawsuit contended that the Democratic National Committee is discriminating against Florida voters. DiMaio argued that party leaders unfairly allowed Nevada and South Carolina to hold their presidential primaries prior to February 5, in part because of the sizable minority populations in both states, but punished Florida and Michigan for skirting the rules.
"How do you ignore the fourth largest state in the nation and millions of Florida voters who exercised their right to vote?" DiMaio said in a statement before the ruling.
Judge Richard A. Lazzara agreed with the DNC, which said that it its practices are not discriminatory and political parties have a constitutional right to determine how delegates are selected in their nominating process. The party has stripped Florida and Michigan of all their delegates for bucking party rules and holding their primaries early.
The fight among over the delegates is set to continue this weekend when the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the DNC is scheduled to meet in Washington to hear appeals by Florida and Michigan. Supporters of both Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have planned protests.
DiMaio's suit is the third filed against the DNC over its decision to strip Florida of its convention delegates. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and Rep. Alcee Hastings, both Democrats from Florida, filed a lawsuit that was dismissed in late 2007 and a Florida Democratic state senator filed a suit last week.
CNN is reporting that DiMaio is preparing to appeal to the Supreme Court. Comments

TITLE: Lawyers Fear for Marri's Sanity


TEXT:






By Josh White
Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, June 4, 2008;
Page A02





Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri is obsessed with the noise variations in an industrial fan, the buzzing of fluorescent lights overhead and the preparation of his dinners. He has stuffed his air vents with food to prevent what he believes are noxious fumes from streaming into his cell, and he worries at times that his lawyers are part of a government conspiracy against him.





The only person currently held as an "enemy combatant" on U.S. soil, Marri has been accused of being a sleeper agent for al-Qaeda , but he is not charged with any crime. After 6 1/2 years of confinement -- the past five in a U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. -- Marri's lawyers argue that his isolation has degraded his mental state and that years of being held incommunicado have left him unable to help in his own defense.

Marri's captivity in an often-forgotten part of the U.S. military detention system, outside the established legal process at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba , raises the legal question of whether the United States can hold him without trial under those conditions until the end of the "war on terror," as the government has argued in court.

In court papers and interviews, Marri's lawyers vividly describe their client's struggle to improve his conditions and his fight against the insanity that psychologists say can follow long-term solitary confinement.

Though Marri's living situation has improved substantially, with the addition of a personal library and a computer, his family and lawyers wonder whether his psyche can hold up long enough for him to collaborate in legal measures meant to secure his release.

"Mr. Almarri has been confined in virtual isolation at the Brig for more than 1,700 days, suffering egregious abuses during much of that time," Marri's lawyers wrote in court papers filed recently in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. "His prolonged isolation and other unlawful conditions of confinement are irreparably harming his health and safety, endangering what remains of his psychological resilience, and jeopardizing his ability to participate meaningfully in his . . . defense."

The Pentagon says Marri has been moved into a unique form of detention with more privileges and concessions than almost anyone held in U.S. high-security prisons. Justice Department lawyers have argued in court papers that Marri's detention is "safe and humane" and provides "him with a number of accommodations and privileges rarely seen in military detention of enemy combatants."

Though held alone and without contact with other detainees -- all of whom are U.S. service members convicted of crimes -- Marri has a 1,000-square-foot dayroom with cable television and recently was given access to a computer. He also can read books from an approximately 400-volume library, including religious texts; has his own exercise equipment; and can read articles from USA Today and a local newspaper, except for news about the counterterrorism effort, along with magazines such as Men's Fitness and PC World .

"We have made a deliberate effort to be sensitive to the fact that he does not interact with other detainees," said Alan Liotta, principal director of the Pentagon's office of detainee affairs. "We knew that this was different, so we have tried to make sure that he has had opportunities along the way that may not be available to others detained as enemy combatants by the Department of Defense."

It is clear that the government thinks Marri is a dangerous man with ties to Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network. He was arrested after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and accused of posing as a graduate student in Illinois while acting as a "sleeper agent" and preparing for follow-up attacks. He had returned to the United States on Sept. 10, 2001.

Initially charged with federal crimes, Marri was moved into military custody in 2003 after President Bush determined him to be an enemy combatant and an immediate threat to U.S. security. Of particular interest to U.S. authorities were Marri's alleged contacts with Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, who is accused of being a paymaster and travel facilitator for al-Qaeda and is scheduled for arraignment before a military commission at Guantanamo Bay this week.

Marri also had allegedly stored on his computer speeches by bin Laden and information on chemicals that could be used as weapons.

TITLE: Clinton Counts on Puerto Rico


TEXT:






By Anne E. Kornblut and Shailagh Murray
Washington Post Staff Writers

Sunday, June 1, 2008;
Page A06





SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, May 31 -- Almost five months after the Democratic campaign season officially began on a freezing Tuesday in Iowa, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) appears headed toward a last easy victory here today in a contest that has been largely overshadowed by the efforts of party officials to bring the nominating process to an orderly close.



Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) continued to campaign in South Dakota over the weekend and prepared for a Tuesday night campaign rally in St. Paul, Minn., where Republicans will hold their convention this summer. Democratic National Committee members met in Washington, to broker a deal over the fate of disputed delegations from Florida and Michigan.

But Clinton continued to focus on Puerto Rico in the hope that it would move her closer to securing a victory in the overall popular vote in the primary season. She spent Saturday on a presumptive victory lap around the island's capital, leading a caravan through neighborhoods on a flatbed truck blaring music.

"Campaigning in Puerto Rico is like one long Puerto Rican Day Parade," Clinton said at one stop, referring to the annual celebration in New York City. "It is incredibly energizing, exciting."

Puerto Rico will award 55 pledged delegates, not enough to put Clinton within striking distance of Obama, who made his only visit to the island last weekend. Instead, Clinton is hoping to add her share of the 500,000 or so likely voters to her popular-vote total and to assert that she is now in close enough range for uncommitted superdelegates to consider choosing her. The final two states with primaries on Tuesday have far fewer delegates at stake -- 15 in South Dakota and 16 in Montana -- and both appear to favor Obama.

The primary here has given Puerto Rico a rare role in an election process that will exclude its voters in the fall. Puerto Rico does not award electoral votes in the general election and has no representation in Congress, two sore points among an array of political concerns that local residents fear will be forgotten once the votes are counted this afternoon.

Election officials are preparing for underwhelming turnout, estimating that a quarter or fewer of the island's 2.3 million registered voters will go to the polls. That would mark a record low in a year when Democratic turnout in many states has shattered records. But there are no local candidates or initiatives on the ballot, and the battle between Clinton and Obama appears all but over.

There are forces at play urging voters not to participate, whether to emphasize the island's exclusion from general-election balloting or make the argument for a Puerto Rico independent from the U.S. government. Some advocacy groups also have complained about the primary's price tag of more than $2 million dollars, money they argue could be better spent on local needs.

Puerto Rico's two major parties -- supporters of maintaining commonwealth status, known as the reds, and statehood backers, known as the blues -- are organized around their views of the island's relationship with the United States. Neither Clinton nor Obama has picked sides in the dispute about the island's status. Both have pledged to resolve the issue during their presidencies. But underscoring the Democratic Party 's lock on the electorate, Obama broke with his usual routine of building his own field operation and is instead relying on prominent red and blue supporters to turn out voters. "You can't avoid it in Puerto Rico," said one Democratic official associated with the Obama campaign.

The Obama campaign has said consistently that it expected to lose the primary here, given Clinton's popularity with Hispanic voters and the high profile she established on the island during her husband's presidency. A poll released last week by the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, conducted for the Puerto Rican newspaper El Vocero and the television network Univision, found that among all Puerto Rican adults, Clinton led Obama 55 percent to 42 percent, with the remainder undecided. But among those who said they were certain to vote, Clinton's lead expanded to 59 percent, compared with 40 percent for Obama.

TITLE: Coach Convicted in BALCO Case


TEXT:






By Amy Shipley
Washington Post Staff Writer

Friday, May 30, 2008;
Page E03





Track coach Trevor Graham was convicted in federal court in San Francisco yesterday on one count of lying to agents in a federal steroids probe, but a 12-person jury could not reach a verdict on two other counts, providing federal prosecutors with only a partial victory.



Jurors found Graham, the former coach of jailed sprinter Marion Jones , guilty of lying when he told federal investigators four years ago that he had not spoken to an admitted steroids dealer since 1997. Prosecutors produced phone records that showed nearly 100 calls from Graham's cellphone to the phone of Angel "Memo" Heredia, the dealer, between 1998 and 2000.

Graham became the ninth person and second track and field coach convicted in connection with the drug investigation involving the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (Balco), a company in Burlingame, Calif., that distributed steroids and other drugs to professional and Olympic athletes. But the deadlock on two of three counts provided the first hiccup in a six-year-old federal investigation that has resulted in seven plea bargains and only two cases that reached trial.

The jury could not reach consensus on the two counts that went to the heart of whether Graham was involved in dealing performance-enhancing drugs to athletes.

Jurors disagreed about whether Graham set athletes up with drugs he obtained from Heredia or referred them to Heredia, and whether he lied willfully when he said he had never met Heredia in person -- despite photos Heredia produced of him and Graham that Heredia claimed came from a 1996 meeting to discuss drugs at his house in Laredo, Tex.

Jury foreman and Oakland, Calif., business owner Frank Stapleton, 59, said he was the lone holdout for conviction on the second count and one of two on the first. In a telephone interview yesterday afternoon, Stapleton said he believed the government had sought to make an example of Graham and was willing "to do a deal with a true devil" -- meaning Heredia -- to win its case.

Stapleton said he found the government's athlete witnesses unconvincing and was particularly disturbed by Heredia's testimony that he personally addressed FedEx shipment receipts to Graham even though the handwriting did not resemble his own.

"The athletes themselves, they just struck me as either they have an ax to grind or were just outright lying," Stapleton said. "The main witness of course, Angel Guillermo 'Memo' Heredia, he was just so outrageous in terms of what he said. He lied to us under oath. It was so clear."

Stapleton, who noted that other jurors disagreed with him, said he was also troubled by the fact that Jeff Novitzky , the lead federal investigator in the Balco case, and a colleague did not tape-record the interview with Graham and wrote up their notes nine days after it occurred. He also wondered why Novitzky and a colleague did not inform Graham of accusations made against him by others during the interview.

"It was like they wanted to catch him," he said. "It got me questioning the government themselves."

Reached by phone, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Parrella declined to comment on whether the government would seek a retrial on the other two charges. Federal prosecutor Jeffrey Finigan also declined to comment in an e-mail.

Graham faces as many as five years in prison, but federal sentencing guidelines suggest he likely will receive much less, probably between zero and six months. He is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 5.

The trial, which included six days of arguments and two of jury deliberation, contained few of the fireworks predicted by Graham and Heredia, who never revealed what both claimed was an extensive client list filled with superstar athletes from around the world.

Graham, who had sent in a syringe full of steroids to anti-doping investigators to help kick off the Balco probe in 2003, had suggested before the trial that he would try to expose the extent of Heredia's drug dealing to show Heredia had motivation to retaliate against him for sending in the syringe. Graham, however, called no witnesses and did not testify.

The only athletes mentioned in court were the half-dozen or so alleged to connect Heredia to Graham between 1996 and 2001.

The most noteworthy disclosures came from Antonio Pettigrew , a relay gold medal winner at the 2000 Summer Games, who admitted using human growth hormone and erythropoietin (EPO) at Graham's behest beginning in 1997. Pettigrew's name appeared on FedEx receipts and a Western Union wire transfer from July 2000 produced by Heredia.

Pettigrew could face charges from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and eventually be stripped of his Olympic gold medal.

Graham's trial provided a look at a few witnesses -- namely, Novitzky -- expected to be called in the case against baseball slugger Barry Bonds , who was indicted last fall on 14 charges of lying in front of a federal grand jury and one count of obstruction of justice. Bonds's case is expected to go to trial next year.

TITLE: Lebanon Votes for Suleiman


TEXT:






By Anthony Shadid and Alia Ibrahim
Washington Post Foreign Service

Sunday, May 25, 2008; 3:18 PM





BEIRUT, May 25 -- Lebanon's parliament elected the army commander, Gen. Michel Suleiman, as president Sunday, filling a post vacant for six months and bringing a symbolic if tenuous end to the country's worst crisis since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990.



The vote for Suleiman was virtually uncontested, already agreed to in a deal negotiated in Qatar last week that ended an 18-month confrontation between forces allied with the government and the opposition led by the Shiite Muslim movement of Hezbollah. Postponed 19 times, it marked the first step in reconstituting what had looked more and more like a failed state in past months: an unfilled presidency, a cabinet deemed illegitimate by the opposition and a parliament that had not met since 2006.

After his election, by 118 votes of 127 possible, a flag-waving crowd gathered in his home town of Amchit erupted in cheers. Fireworks detonated over Beirut, cars blared their horns and church bells tolled. Staccato bursts of celebratory gunfire rattled across a capital that, less than two weeks ago, witnessed pitched gunbattles redolent of civil war.

"I call upon all of you, politicians and citizens, to begin a new stage that is called Lebanon and the Lebanese," Suleiman, who forego his military uniform for the civilian suit of a politician, told parliament. To repeated rounds of applause, he said the country had paid dearly for what he called national unity. "Let us preserve it hand in hand."

The deal that brought Suleiman to power represented another setback in the region for the United States, which has long sought to isolate Hezbollah, a group backed by Syria and Iran . Under the agreement, Hezbollah and its allies will have a veto in the coming cabinet -- the group's demand since the crisis began after war with Israel in 2006 -- and demonstrated its clear role today as the single most powerful force in Lebanon.

The vote itself represented a rare moment of consensus across the political, social and ideological divide that still fractures Lebanon -- from the country's posture toward Israel to what foreign patron will play the greatest role in Lebanese politics, long vulnerable to regional crises. The foreign ministers of Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and France attended, as did the emir of Qatar, who was seated at the podium of parliament in recognition of his government's role in the negotiations that nearly collapsed twice. In a telling sign, the United States was represented only by a congressional delegation.

"This last crisis ended with a winner and a vanquished," said the emir, Sheik Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani. "The winner is Lebanon, and the vanquished is the feud, and this needs to be clear to all -- today, tomorrow and forever."

Streets in the capital and elsewhere Sunday were awash in Lebanese flags and posters celebrating Suleiman's presidency. "The leader, the president," one read. "Congratulations, Lebanon," said another. Weary of almost continuous crises that have beset Lebanon since former prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri was assassinated by a car bomb in Beirut in 2005, many residents, regardless of their stance on the crisis, have greeted the agreement and election of Suleiman with relief that the country averted civil war, consolation perhaps muted by frustration that the confrontation lasted as long as it did.

Reservations have surged at hotels here, life has returned to a downtown paralyzed by an 18-month opposition sit-in and the stock market has rebounded.

Often heard in Lebanon, though, is the idea that the country has embarked on a truce, and no more. The question of Hezbollah's arsenal remains pressing for government supporters, who tried to address the issue in the Doha talks. Suleiman is expected to lead a dialogue over the issue with rival leaders, and both sides are expected to wrestle over the coming cabinet's official position on what Hezbollah calls the resistance.

The cabinet itself will remain in power through next summer, when parliamentary elections are expected to again enshrine in power the same leaders, some of them veterans of the civil war with almost-feudal sway over their followers.

Suleiman, 59, was appointed army commander in 1998, when Syria still exercised tutelage over Lebanon. He rose through the ranks of an army that, particularly in the 1990s, worked closely with Syria and Hezbollah, which fought a guerrilla war against Israel in southern Lebanon until its withdrawal in 2000. He emerged as a candidate of the opposition, then drew the backing of government supporters to fill a post vacant since the term of Emile Lahoud, a Syrian ally and former general, ended in November.

Both had their grievances with him: The opposition was critical of the military for shooting on protesters in January; government supporters were angry at what they saw as the military's acquiescence in allowing fighters of Hezbollah and its allies to enter predominantly Muslim West Beirut earlier this month, where they routed government-backed militiamen in hours, forcing the government into the eventual compromise.

"The gun should only be pointed against the enemy," said Suleiman, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause. "We will not allow it another direction."

TITLE: Director Sydney Pollack Dies


TEXT:






By Adam Bernstein
Washington Post Staff Writer

Tuesday, May 27, 2008;
Page B06





Sydney Pollack, 73, a director and producer of popular Hollywood movies for nearly four decades, including the comedy "Tootsie," and who won Academy Awards for "Out of Africa," died May 26 at his home in Los Angeles. He had cancer.





Mr. Pollack, who called himself "Mr. Mainstream," was wildly successful at moviemaking with mass appeal but drew mixed reviews during a prolific career.

His best-remembered work could be provocative, timely and sensitively crafted: "Tootsie" (1982) was hilarious and underscored aspects of the feminist struggle; the taut spy story "Three Days of the Condor" (1975) captured Nixon-era paranoia; "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" (1969), though set at a Depression-era dance marathon, resonated with young ticket buyers who saw the rigged contest as a reflection of modern society.

Mr. Pollack's movies often emphasized the loner at conflict with society, whether a fur trapper in the wilderness in "Jeremiah Johnson" (1972) or a cowboy who tries to recover his soul after selling out in "The Electric Horseman" (1979) with Robert Redford and Jane Fonda.

He saw Redford as his ideal collaborator and cast him in seven movies, from "This Property Is Condemned" (1966) to "Havana" (1990), because of what he considered his "very internal, rather understated" acting style as well as a dark undercurrent he found appealing beneath Redford's "golden boy" exterior.

Redford returned the compliment, telling Film Comment magazine, "Sydney's the one director that seems to read me best. . . . Basically he's a romantic."

Audiences embraced two of Mr. Pollack's best-known romance stories: "The Way We Were" (1973) with Redford as a WASP writer and Barbra Streisand as a Jewish political activist during the Hollywood blacklist; and "Out of Africa" (1985), a $30 million production based on Danish author Isak Dinesen's years in Kenya and her complicated affair with a free-spirited and handsome pilot.

The latter film, which earned Oscars for Mr. Pollack for directing and producing, starred Meryl Streep and Redford against a backdrop likened by critics to a National Geographic spread.

Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader complimented Mr. Pollack's craftsmanship and taste, saying that "although the denouement is a bit overextended, he never yields to facile, insistent sentimentality -- his effects are honestly won."

Many others found both films saccharine and ponderous, and Mr. Pollack spoke of his own "tendency by nature to be heavy-handed," which he attributed to his early training as a television director "where you have to grab the audience in the first 10 minutes."

Few disputed that Mr. Pollack was a master of pulling terrific performances from actors. Those who won Oscars under his direction included Gig Young as a cynical dance-marathon announcer in "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" and Jessica Lange as an emotionally vulnerable actress in "Tootsie."

But even in his less-regarded works, many actors earned Oscar nominations, including Paul Newman and Melinda Dillon in the newspaper libel drama "Absence of Malice" (1981) and Holly Hunter in "The Firm" (1993), based on the John Grisham legal thriller.









Mr. Pollack's skill with performers has been credited to his start in show business as a theater and television actor in the 1950s. With his glasses and curly hair, he became a recognizable presence over the years, thanks to memorable cameo appearances in films and on television.





As a young man, he had been a student of Sanford Meisner, who taught the acting technique known as "the Method," which uses the performer's emotional memory to add realistic touches to a role.

"He was the most influential person in my life in terms of my thinking about drama, about life itself," Mr. Pollack said of Meisner in 1993.

"Everything I do is from the point of view of acting," he added. "I think of cinematography from an actor's point of view. My scripts are from an actor's point of view. Once you find the spine of a part, it becomes a wonderful mold for the whole movie. You measure every single thing against it."

In later years, Mr. Pollack had a significant impact as a producer by using his reputation for commercial success to support other directors, some of them untested. Last year, he backed screenwriter and first-time director Tony Gilroy on the critically praised "Michael Clayton," a thriller with George Clooney.

He also teamed with writer-producer-director Anthony Minghella to produce such films as "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999), "Iris" (2001), "The Quiet American" (2002) and "Cold Mountain" (2003).

Movie critic and historian David Sterritt said Mr. Pollack's "main importance was as a kind of hyphenate -- someone who produced, directed and sometimes acted."

"He was one of the consummate professionals of the last 40 years or so in Hollywood," Sterritt said. "On his own films, or those he supported as a producer or actor, he reached a high level of achievement, if not always a high level of art."

Sydney Pollack was born July 1, 1934, in Lafayette, Ind., and raised in South Bend.

He once described himself as an "unpopular and rather sad kid" while growing up in Indiana and made awkward attempts to fit in socially by playing sports. He once took up boxing but, with his poor vision, "didn't see the punches until they were too close."

Movies enchanted him, but he vividly recalled that his father, a boxer-turned-pharmacist, discouraged his ambitions as an actor as an unmanly trade. Sydney Pollack's two siblings went into entertainment: Bernie became a costume designer, and Sharon became a dance instructor.

After high school, Sydney Pollack went to New York in 1954 and studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse under Meisner, who was so impressed with Mr. Pollack that he made him his assistant. Mr. Pollack's students included Robert Duvall, Rip Torn, Brenda Vaccaro and Claire Griswold, whom he married in 1958.









In addition to his wife, of Los Angeles, survivors include two daughters, Rebecca Pollack and Rachel Pollack, both of Los Angeles; a brother; and six grandchildren. A son, Steven Pollack, died in a small-plane crash in 1993.





In the 1950s, Sydney Pollack began making regular appearances on TV anthology programs such as "Playhouse 90." Director John Frankenheimer brought Mr. Pollack to Hollywood in 1961 to work as a dialogue coach on the juvenile delinquency drama "The Young Savages."

Mr. Pollack said he bonded with the film's star, Burt Lancaster, over the fact that neither had been to college. Lancaster smoothed the way for Mr. Pollack's entry into Hollywood by urging powerful agent and mogul Lew Wasserman to hire him as a director.

He said Lancaster told Wasserman: "He can't be worse than some of those bums you got workin' for you now."

Mr. Pollack directed many TV series and won the 1966 best directing Emmy Award for an episode of "Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre." He also took occasional acting jobs and made his movie debut in the supporting role of a sergeant in "War Hunt" (1962), a drama set during the Korean War that featured the largely unknown Redford.

In 1965, Mr. Pollack won his first movie directing credit for "The Slender Thread," a suicide help-line drama with Sidney Poitier and Anne Bancroft. Mr. Pollock later dismissed the melodramatic film as "a dreadful picture," and he was not contradicted by reviewers.

He also bombed critically with his next three films, including "This Property is Condemned" (1966), based on a Tennessee Williams one-act play; the satiric western "The Scalphunters" (1968), starring Lancaster; and the anti-war drama "Castle Keep" (1969), based on a William Eastlake novel.

He began his first long run of hits with "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?," a grim film with Jane Fonda. The movie proved an unexpected commercial success and brought Pollack an Oscar nomination for directing and launched him to the front rank of directors.

Most reviewers found "Tootsie," with Dustin Hoffman as an out-of-work actor masquerading as a woman to get a job on a TV soap opera, probably his finest achievement.

Critic Pauline Kael wrote that Mr. Pollack seemed to direct with less self-consciousness, especially in opening scenes showing what she called "a crackling, rapid-fire presentation of the hopes versus the realities of out-of-work actors' lives."

Mr. Pollack's most notable acting role may have been as Hoffman's long-suffering agent in "Tootsie," a part he was said to have taken only reluctantly after Hoffman, in female character, hounded him with notes that read, "Please be my agent! Love, Dorothy."

He had key supporting roles in Woody Allen's "Husbands and Wives" (1992) as an adulterer, Robert Altman's "The Player" (1992) as a Hollywood lawyer and Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (1999) as a creepy doctor, parts he took because he was curious about how other famous directors worked.

He also had a stint as a wife-killing oncologist on the HBO mob drama "The Sopranos."

Directing and production credits included "The Yakuza" (1974) with Robert Mitchum as an American private eye in Japan; "Bobby Deerfield (1977) with Al Pacino as a race car driver who falls for a woman with cancer, Marthe Keller; "Random Hearts" (1999), a romantic drama with Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas falling in love after their spouses die in a plane crash; and "The Interpreter" (2005), a thriller with Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn set at the United Nations.

In 2005, he made his first documentary, "Sketches of Frank Gehry," after meeting the celebrated architect at a Los Angeles party.

Mr. Pollack told the Christian Science Monitor that he hoped his own films, made for broad audiences, would follow the tradition of many movies of the 1930s and 1940s dismissed as "standard studio fare" but are now seen as great art.

He added that he was motivated by two factors: "First, I have to satisfy the needs of popular art. Second, I don't want to be intellectually insulting. I want to raise issues and questions that are sufficiently intriguing -- so people I care about will like them, too."

LONDON, June 4 -- For much of the world, Sen. Barack Obama 's victory in the Democratic primaries was a moment to admire the United States at a time when the nation's image abroad has been seriously damaged.



From hundreds of supporters crowded around televisions in rural Kenya, Obama's ancestral homeland, to jubilant Britons writing "WE DID IT!" on the Brits for Barack discussion board on Facebook , people celebrated what they called an important racial and generational milestone for the United States.

"This is close to a miracle. I was certain that some things will not happen in my lifetime," said Sunila Patel, 62, a widow encountered on the streets of New Delhi. "A black president of the U.S. will mean that there will be more American tolerance for people around the world who are different."

The primary race generated unprecedented interest outside the United States, much of it a reflection of a desire for change from the policies of President Bush , who surveys show is deeply unpopular around the globe. At the same time, many people abroad seemed impressed -- sometimes even shocked -- by the wide-open nature of U.S. democracy, and the history-making race between a woman and a black man.

"The primaries showed that the U.S. is actually the nation we had believed it to be, a place that is open-minded enough to have a woman or an African American as its president," said Minoru Morita, a Tokyo political analyst.

While Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has admirers, especially from her days as first lady, interviews on four continents suggested that Obama is the candidate who has most captured the world's imagination.

"Obama is the exciting image of what we always hoped America was," said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, a British foreign policy institute. "We have immensely enjoyed the ride and can't wait for the next phase."

The presumptive Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain , who has extensive overseas experience, is known and respected in much of the world. Interviews suggested that McCain is more popular than Obama in countries such as Israel , where McCain is particularly admired for his hard line against Iran .

"Although no one will admit it, Israeli leaders are worried about Obama," said Eytan Gilboa, a political scientist at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. "The feeling is that this is the time to be tough in foreign policy toward the Middle East, and he's going to be soft."

In China , leaders are widely believed to be wary that a Democratic administration might put up barriers to Chinese exports to the United States.

But elsewhere, people were praising Obama, 46, whose emphasis on using the Internet helped make him better known in more nations than perhaps any U.S. primary candidate in history.

In Kenya, Obama's victory was greeted with unvarnished glee. In Kisumu, close to the home of Obama's late father, hundreds crowded around televisions Wednesday morning to watch Obama's victory speech, chanting "Obama tosha!" -- "Obama is enough!"

EMMA CLIPPINGER HAS RECENTLY GOTTEN OFF A 24-HOUR FLIGHT FROM AFRICA, but you'd never know it to look at her. Wearing tall black pumps and an ash gray suit, she commands the stage of a Manhattan boardroom without the slightest sign of jet lag.





Clippinger, a junior at Brown University , is delivering a PowerPoint presentation to a panel of executives at the investment banking firm JPMorgan. On the screen behind her is a photograph of Rwanda, showing verdant fields of bananas and corn. The scene may look healthy, but it's not, the 22-year-old tells the executives. The banana and corn crops are so dominant in that nation that many Rwandans get too much starch and not enough other nutrients.

"This," she says confidently, "is the picture we're trying to change."

Clippinger is a passionate and resourceful young woman poised to make her mark on the world, and the investment bankers are practically salivating as they listen. What Clippinger wants from them is charitable funding to support Gardens for Health International, a nonprofit venture she co-founded with Emily Morell, a junior at Yale, that aims to improve the nutrition of HIV-positive Rwandans by helping them diversify their diets, making the anti-retroviral drugs they take more effective.

What the bankers want from Clippinger is something more complicated and long-term. Simply put, they want her to like them. They want her to understand that investment banking isn't just about making money; at JPMorgan, they say, it's about making money and then giving some of it back to the world. They want her to be their emissary by returning to college and telling classmates how globally oriented and civic-minded JPMorgan seems. And if she likes them enough to apply for a summer internship or a full-time job after she graduates next year, they want that, too.

But if she chooses not to do all or any of those things, there are other promising candidates who might. At the bank this morning are about 30 students organized into 10 teams. Over the course of the day, each team will pitch a charitable endeavor, and the winning project will be awarded $25,000. The finalists were chosen from more than 100 projects submitted by students around the world as part of what JPMorgan calls its Good Venture Competition, a contest for undergraduates that is part genuine philanthropic giveaway, part recruiting gimmick.

For a relatively small investment, the JPMorgan execs have assembled before them some of the most desirable potential hires in the world. In addition to teams from Stanford , Harvard, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania , Washington and Lee and other blue-chip universities, there are entrants from England and Ireland. These standouts were asked to submit rÃ©sumÃ©s along with their project packets, and Clippinger's, which is typical, shows the depth of their achievements. Clippinger is a developmental studies and comparative literature double major who has spent time not only in Rwanda but also France and Senegal. She captains the Brown varsity equestrian team, worked as a production assistant on Martin Scorsese 's "The Departed," interned with the Clinton Foundation in Africa, and speaks fluent French as well as basic Kinyarwanda, one of Rwanda's official languages, and Wolof, which is spoken in Senegal. Her teammate, Morell, is a neurobiology major with a grade-point average of 3.95 who has worked in Thailand, published in the Yale Journal of Public Health and founded a public policy center.

Small wonder that around the boardroom are JPMorgan recruiting posters saying, "This Is Where You Need to Be." On tables in a refreshment room lie recruiting packets containing articles touting how there are now more women on the trading floor and how JPMorgan supports gay workers.

Clippinger, in a break between the presentations, will allow with some amusement that she was a little naive: She didn't anticipate that, in addition to being about giving back, this competition would also be about getting hired.

SHE'D BETTER GET USED TO IT. For the graduates pouring out of public and private universities across the country and into the newly lush landscape of postcollegiate employment, the competition for their services has perhaps never been so creative, the goody bags so well-stocked. The so-called millennial generation -- students born in the 1980s and '90s -- are one of the most heavily recruited cohorts to enter the American workforce, their hearts and minds incessantly battled over. That's because the baby boomer generation, which has dominated the U.S. employment market since the 1970s, is finally ready to retire. Six decades after the boom began, employers are facing massive losses in their white-collar workforces. As they troll for replacements, they are courting what may be the best-credentialed graduates ever produced by American colleges. Raised in the age of high-speed Internet, deregulated airline prices, ubiquitous study-abroad programs and wildly competitive college admissions, today's juniors and seniors are computer-literate, well-traveled, hyper-groomed and accustomed to competing for what they want.

The frenzy to hire these prodigies is called "the war for talent." It is being waged even as gas prices soar, companies downsize and consumer confidence plummets. And, as well qualified as this group seems to be, the graduates' appeal also lies in the fact that they'll be paid less than more experienced workers would be.

"You want to get them now," says Claudia Tattanelli, CEO of Universum North America, a firm that consults about "employer branding." Speaking to an assemblage of recruitment officers at an all-day hiring conference at Howard University , Tattanelli advises them to snatch students right out of college, rather than waiting a few years when they will be more expensive and less likely to want to move. "Later costs so much money," she warns.

TITLE: Guilty Plea in D.C. Tax Scandal


TEXT:






By Sylvia Moreno
Washington Post Staff Writer

Friday, May 30, 2008;
Page A01





A key figure in the D.C. tax scandal pleaded guilty yesterday to two felony charges, admitting that he funneled millions of dollars in illegal property tax refunds through his plumbing company and used the money in part to build an ocean-view home in the Virgin Islands, buy a Bentley and purchase Washington Wizards season tickets.



Richard Walters is among 11 people charged in what authorities have called the biggest corruption scandal in D.C. government history. Authorities have said that as much as $50 million was stolen in a scheme that stretched back almost 20 years, and only a fraction of the money has been recovered.

As part of his guilty plea, Walters, 49, must cooperate with prosecutors and testify in court proceedings. That could put him on the witness stand against his sister, Harriette Walters , the former D.C. tax office manager who is accused of engineering the thefts.

He also agreed to give up what remains of his share of the illegal proceeds: two properties in the Virgin Islands, two homes in Bowie, jewelry, the $160,000 Bentley and four other cars, and more than $1.4 million that authorities traced to 13 bank accounts. He earlier turned over an additional $405,000, and prosecutors took control of $480,000 he had stashed in the Virgin Islands.

Nearly seven months after the scandal came to light, the pace is picking up on the legal front. Walters was the fourth person and second Walters family member to plead guilty -- all within the past month. The prosecution is following a typical pattern for large-scale investigations: Authorities are gathering guilty pleas and promises of cooperation from various defendants as they build bigger cases against the two alleged leaders of the scam, Harriette Walters and her niece, Jayrece Turnbull , who allegedly handled at least $12 million of the stolen money through bank accounts she created.

Harriette Walters and Turnbull are the only defendants now in jail, having been locked up since their arrests in November.

Richard Walters, who has remained free since his arrest that month, appeared before U.S. District Judge Alexander Williams Jr. in Greenbelt and pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property and conspiracy to launder money. The two charges carry up to 30 years in prison, but Walters will probably receive less under federal sentencing guidelines. He is to be sentenced Sept. 8.

After the judge outlined the ramifications of his plea, Walters was asked whether he had any questions.

"I don't have any questions, your honor," Walters replied. "I just have one simple statement of apologizing to the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland."

Walters, of Bowie, is a licensed plumber who owned a business in Maryland called Helmet Plumbing. But prosecutors said much of the money flowing into its bank account came from D.C. taxpayers.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan C. Su said in court that Helmet Plumbing cashed $4.9 million in illegal property tax refunds allegedly steered to the firm by Harriette Walters. There were 15 checks in all, issued from March 2001 to May 2007 and ranging from about $95,000 to about $540,000, prosecutors said.

According to court documents, Walters and his sister used the money transferred to Helmet Plumbing to enrich themselves and others. The transactions included transferring more than $1 million to accounts controlled by Richard Walters and $461,000 to his sister. At least three co-defendants also got money: Turnbull received more than $230,000; Connie Alexander, a friend of Harriette Walters's, got $84,600, and Diane Gustus , a co-worker in the D.C. tax office, got $10,000, the documents said.

Prosecutors said Richard Walters used about $225,000 for projects at a home he built in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; $47,000 for season tickets to the Washington Wizards; and nearly $60,000 to cover purchases at Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue .

Virgin Islands records show that Richard Walters bought more than half an acre in Estate Sorgenfri on the north shore of St. Thomas in September 2002 for $45,000. In February 2003, he applied for a building permit to construct a house on the property. Blueprints on file with the building department show a two-story, five-bedroom, four-bath house with a two-car garage and a total of 3,775 square feet of living space. In the permit application, Walters listed the estimated cost of the house at $415,192 and said that he was in charge of the construction.

The large white stucco house with a royal blue galvanized roof and blue trim sits nestled into a hillside down from the main road. It faces Caret Bay West and the Atlantic Ocean and has a full view of two small uninhabited islands.

The second property that Walters agreed to give up is an undeveloped parcel in Estate Fortuna on the west end of the island.

Real estate agent Rosemary Sauter, owner of RE/MAX Dream Properties in St. Thomas, said in an interview that her office did business in 2006 and 2007 with Richard Walters and his nephew, Ricardo Walters , another defendant in the case. Richard Walters attempted to make a deal for another property overlooking the Caribbean and left $9,500 in escrow money. The deal fell through, and now federal authorities have the $9,500.

Ricardo Walters is among those who recently pleaded guilty, admitting to netting about $795,000 in illegal money. The other guilty pleas came from Walter Jones , a former Bank of America manager who admitted handling bogus refund checks and receiving more than $366,000 in the scheme, and Marilyn Yoon, a former employee of the Tysons Corner Louis Vuitton store who said she got $150,000 from Harriette Walters for handling a fraudulent check.

Richard Walters was in trouble once before. Court documents filed in U.S. District Court in the Virgin Islands show that he pleaded guilty in February 2000 to one count of possession of a stolen money order. According to court papers, he was a postal clerk in St. Croix and converted two $700 postal money orders "for his own use or gain."

For that crime, Walters was sentenced to weekends in jail for four months, two years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service. He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine and full restitution.

After yesterday's plea, attorney David Greenbaum said neither he nor his client would have any comment until after the sentencing.

Staff researcher Meg Smith contributed to this report.

TITLE: AP: New Air Force Head Chosen 


TEXT:






By ROBERT BURNS
The Associated Press

Friday, June 6, 2008; 3:26 PM





WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates is likely to recommend to President Bush that he nominate a former Air Force executive, Michael B. Donley, to the service's top civilian post, a senior defense official said Friday.



Donley, who was acting secretary of the Air Force for seven months in 1993 and served as the service's top financial officer from 1989 to 1993, would replace Michael Wynne, who was fired by Gates on Thursday along with the Air Force's top uniformed officer, Gen. Michael Moseley.

The senior defense official spoke on condition of anonymity because Gates has not yet made a formal recommendation to Bush.

Donley currently is the Pentagon's director of administration and management.

He has held a variety of strategy and policy positions in government, including a stint on the National Security Council from 1984 to 1989. Before that he was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee staff. He served in the Army from 1972 to 1975. He earned bachelors and masters degrees from the University of Southern California.

White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said Bush spoke with Gates about the shake up on Wednesday.

It was unclear whom Gates would choose to replace Moseley, who has been Air Force chief of staff since September 2005. Among the four-star generals thought to be candidates are Gen. Norton Schwartz, the commander of U.S. Transportation Command, who has a special operations background; Gen. John Corley, the commander of Air Combat Command; and Gen. Kevin Chilton, head of U.S. Strategic Command, which writes and maintains the nation's strategic nuclear war plan.

Gates announced on Thursday that he was replacing the Air Force's top leadership, saying a shake up was required to ensure that the service improve its standards and performance in safeguarding its nuclear weapons and the sensitive components associated with the strategic arsenal.

Gates said his decision was based mainly on the damning conclusions of an internal report that detailed the mistaken shipment to Taiwan of four Air Force electrical fuses for ballistic missile warheads. And he linked the underlying causes of that slip-up to another startling incident: the flight last August of a B-52 bomber that was mistakenly armed with six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.

The report drew the stunning conclusion that a long decline in the Air Force's nuclear standards has been a known shortcoming but has not been effectively addressed for over a decade.

Gates said an internal investigation led by Adm. Kirkland Donald found a common theme in the B-52 and Taiwan incidents: "a decline in the Air Force's nuclear mission focus and performance" and a failure by Air Force leaders to respond effectively.

Wynne's resignation letter to Gates was released Friday. He offered no apology, saying control of the Air Force's nuclear-related assets is a "firm commitment" by the Air Force to the nation and that he has been a long-time believer in accepting responsibility and being accountable.

TITLE: Democrats Enjoy Financial Edge


TEXT:






By Matthew Mosk
Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, June 7, 2008;
Page A01





Sen. Barack Obama will head into the general election with the ability to raise significantly more money than his Republican opponent, an extremely rare position for a Democrat and one that could give him a huge advantage in mobilizing supporters, reaching voters and competing across the country.



Party leaders say they expect Obama to surpass the more than quarter-billion dollars he amassed during the primaries, buoyed by a fundraising list with more than 1.5 million names, an uncommon knack for attracting money online and the expected addition of scores of established bundlers who helped bankroll Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign.

Obama's advantage, which could stretch into the tens of millions over Republican Sen. John McCain , would allow the senator from Illinois to build a far more robust field operation and let him drench radio and television airwaves in a much broader array of states, including those where Democrats do not traditionally compete. He would also have enough money to enjoy the luxury of making mistakes, whereas any poor choices McCain makes would be felt much more acutely.

"From my vantage point, the enthusiasm is there, and for the first time we're seeing the [Internet] fundraising and the traditional fundraising both pulling the rope the same way," said Mitchell Berger, a Florida lawyer who helped oversee fundraising for President Bill Clinton in 1996 and for Vice President Al Gore in 2000, and who is raising money for Obama. "More than any time in my memory, Democrats are ready to go."

While not all of McCain's aides and supporters agree that Obama will substantially outraise him this fall, they said the senator from Arizona is uniquely positioned to wage a lean, underdog effort, much as he did in the Republican primaries. They said his knack for parlaying late-night television appearances and free-wheeling bus tours into free media attention have proved that money is not the only way to win.

"Senator McCain has demonstrated he can run a competitive campaign without spending as much as his opponents," said senior adviser Charles R. Black Jr. "He just finished demonstrating it."

McCain also appears confident that his fundraising will continue to accelerate. Yesterday, campaign manager Rick Davis announced that McCain will air ads in 10 swing states, including costly markets such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, from now until November. Davis called it "the single most significant ad buy since this election cycle began two years ago."

McCain campaign officials told reporters yesterday that their fundraising will be bolstered by the Republican National Committee , which had more than $53 million in the bank at the start of the month; in comparison, the Democratic National Committee had less than $5 million on hand.

Republicans have enjoyed a fundraising advantage in the modern era of presidential politics, and only Democrats backed by the power of incumbency, such as President Bill Clinton in 1996, have been in a position to compete.

In 2000, for instance, George W. Bush raised $95.5 million during the primaries, almost double Gore's $48 million. And during the general election, when both candidates accepted an equal share of federal funds, the RNC outraised its Democratic counterpart by almost $120 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The pattern continued in 2004.

This year, that pattern has flipped. Obama has raised $265 million over 15 months, and he had $46 million on hand at the end of April. McCain finished the same period having raised $96 million. He raised another $21.5 million in May and finished the month with $31.5 million in the bank. Obama has not released May figures.

While McCain appears poised to accept $85 million in federal money for the general election -- funding that will kick in after he formally accepts the nomination in September -- Obama has not indicated whether he will honor an earlier pledge to do the same. His top fundraisers say they expect him to forgo the funds in favor of raising money with no upper limits.

TITLE: A Campaign's Final Chapter


TEXT:






By Anne E. Kornblut and Dan Balz
Washington Post Staff Writers

Thursday, June 5, 2008;
Page A01





In a campaign of near-deaths and premature obituaries, the night of May 6 will be remembered inside Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign as the moment it really ended.



The staff had settled into the war room at the campaign's Arlington headquarters. Mexican food, as always, had been ordered. The candidate was in Indianapolis. All anticipated another good night in a campaign that had put together an impressive streak of big-state primary victories in Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania over the previous two months.

But whatever slim hopes Clinton had for an improbable comeback died with the disappointing results in the last two big primaries of the campaign -- a narrower-than-hoped-for victory in Indiana and a double-digit loss in North Carolina -- and the commentary that accompanied them. When NBC 's Tim Russert flatly declared the Democratic race over around midnight, one adviser recalled, "the air came out of the room."

In subsequent days, a debate that had raged throughout the long nomination battle -- whether to attack Barack Obama or present Clinton positively -- virtually disappeared. What negative ads had been run were removed. The senator from New York, save for two notable slips, stopped criticizing Obama and focused on making the case for herself. Other defeats and other victories, including a win in West Virginia by 41 points, followed.

But there was a sense of resignation within the campaign. She would carry on, but the outcome was inevitable. "She could accept losing," one adviser said. "She could not accept quitting."

In many respects, the final chapter of the Clinton campaign was the best of times for a candidacy that began with Clinton seen as an almost-inevitable nominee and ended with the former first lady fighting off calls to quit. Aides look back at a campaign that, as it finished, functioned effectively and mostly collegially after months of turmoil and bitter internecine warfare. Clinton found her voice, liberated by the reality of the hill she had to climb and by her ability to focus on rising economic concerns among voters.

"Over the last four months we've won more states, more delegates, more votes," communications director Howard Wolfson said yesterday. "We won two states that we started out behind in and were not supposed to win. I'm proud of the way we closed and wish that that level of success had been the case throughout."

In reality, Clinton lost the nomination long before May 6. The early mistakes have been well documented: a flawed message that focused too much on inevitability and not enough on change; a failure to make Clinton more appealing to Iowa voters; a strategic miscalculation about the importance of caucus states; a spouse, former president Bill Clinton , who intruded as much as he aided his wife; a campaign that was at times dysfunctional.

Her success came mostly when it was too late. Clinton's strategy was predicated by necessity on convincing uncommitted superdelegates that she would be a stronger nominee than Obama. Despite victories in key states over the past few months, she and her advisers found those party leaders and elected officials impervious to events.

Asked why the campaign could never crack the superdelegates, who had started out predisposed toward her candidacy, Geoff Garin , one of the top strategists, said yesterday, "I think it's a mystery and an irony, and an irony in the sense that Hillary was seen as inevitable when it didn't matter and Obama was seen as inevitable when it did."


Obama's Troubles

Clinton's victories in the Ohio and Texas primaries on March 4 revived her candidacy, and a series of mistakes by Obama gave it hope.

The first came on March 14, when an explosive video of Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , came to light. Clinton and her team saw the Wright controversy for what it was, a major challenge to Obama's candidacy and a potentially significant problem in a general election.

TITLE: Dairy Buy Is Typical of Ch&#225;vez


TEXT:






By Juan Forero
Washington Post Foreign Service

Saturday, June 7, 2008;
Page A01





BARQUISIMETO, Venezuela -- Mauricio Herrera describes himself as a devoted soldier in President Hugo ChÃ¡vez 's self-styled revolution. So when oil workers opposed to ChÃ¡vez went on strike in 2002, Herrera was among loyalists at the state oil company who revived production.



Now, with the government bedeviled by food shortages, Herrera has been called upon to carry out the president's orders in an entirely different sector: milk.

A chemical engineer with 32 years of experience in oil, Herrera is working at Los Andes Dairy, which was recently acquired by the state oil company. He is responsible for running a venerable firm with two pasteurization plants, 52 distributorships and 3,000 employees. His instructions are to boost production and ease Venezuela's dairy shortages.

In a country that has seen the state increasingly inject itself into the economy, nationalizing companies, applying currency controls and setting prices, the acquisition of Los Andes in this western city embodies ChÃ¡vez's state-does-it-all philosophy.

The approach has largely discouraged private investment in Venezuela, while making some foods scarce. But since ChÃ¡vez first won office in 1998, he has wrested control of oil from multinational energy firms and nationalized the phone company, electric utilities and, more recently, an Argentine-controlled steel producer.

Shifting away from the production of yogurt and oatmeal -- products Herrera dismissively says the former owners churned out to generate profits -- Los Andes has ramped up milk production eightfold in a bid to achieve what the government calls "nutritional sovereignty."

"It's our responsibility," said Herrera, 57, who has a slight goatee and has learned to speak about milk with the same enthusiasm he once reserved for oil. "This is a question of conscience. This is a company that has to have a socialist focus."

ChÃ¡vez announced the purchase of Los Andes in March as a solution to the food shortages that have chipped away at his government's popularity. Herrera and officials at the oil company said they did not know what the state paid for Los Andes, though milk industry officials said it was $180 million.

The president said he decided to purchase the dairy company after Rafael RamÃ­rez , the president of Petroleos de Venezuela , the state oil company, told him about it.

"He said, 'I have good news, they're selling a company,' " ChÃ¡vez said recently on his nationally televised show, "Hello President." "I reviewed the characteristics of the company, and I said, 'Let's not waste a day. Buy it.' "

Although economists blame the food shortages here in part on rising demand, the president has said unbridled capitalism, unscrupulous speculators and hoarding by political opponents are to blame. He has also characterized the struggle to increase food production as part of an epic battle between his revolution and imperialist forces.

"We're going to have good nutrition for a people who deserve it," he said. "We're going to defeat the imperialist plan."

TITLE: Officials Release Girls' Bodies

By Keith L. Alexander
Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, June 4, 2008;
Page B01





The small white caskets with silver trim were in front of the altar, next to pictures of the two little girls who died. A tiny pair of pink ballet slippers and a pink and white teddy bear were positioned on each closed coffin.



Nearly five months after their bodies were found in a Southeast Washington rowhouse, N'Kiah Fogle, 6, and Aja Fogle, 5, were buried yesterday after a service attended by about 130 mourners at Greater Mount Calvary Holy Church. The funeral program quoted Matthew 19:14: "Suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me: for such is the kingdom of heaven."

The girls' mother, Banita Jacks , was miles away, held in the D.C. jail on charges that she killed N'Kiah, Aja and two other daughters, Brittany Jacks , 16, and Tatianna Jacks , 11. The older girls will be buried this weekend after a service in La Plata. The girls' bodies were found Jan. 9, and authorities have estimated that they had been dead since summer. Apart from Banita Jacks, no one had reported seeing the children since May 2007.

Yesterday, relatives filled several rows of the church in Northeast Washington. They listened as soloists sang "Jesus Loves Me," with its lyrics "Little ones to Him belong," and another song, "When I Spend My Vacation in Heaven." The singing of "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," about trusting God's love, prompted such an emotional response that many people left the church to compose themselves.

In between the caskets was a poster-size bulletin board of photos of N'Kiah and Aja laughing and playing together, with their father, Nathaniel Fogle Jr., who died of cancer last year, and the other sisters. The service was organized by Fogle's relatives.

According to the obituary given to mourners, N'Kiah was nicknamed "Chunky Munk" among family members and attended Meridian Public Charter School, where she was learning Spanish. Aja, nicknamed "Red Baron," also attended Meridian and loved coloring, drawing, jumping rope and playing with her dolls. Like so many children their ages, both enjoyed watching " SpongeBob SquarePants " and " Dora the Explorer ."

The service offered many memories of the girls but no answers about their deaths. The funeral was not held sooner partly because forensics experts are still trying to determine exactly how they died. Because the bodies were so seriously decomposed, the experts can say only that Brittany was stabbed and that the other girls showed signs of trauma.

Jacks, 33, has told police that the girls were possessed by demons and that they died in their sleep. She has denied killing them.

Family members declined to comment yesterday. In the program, they wrote of the girls: "Their passing leaves within our hearts an enormous feeling of real loneliness, but also cherished memories that will last a lifetime."

The funerals were scheduled after relatives petitioned the D.C. medical examiner's office to release the bodies. This weekend's services for Brittany and Tatianna are being organized by the family of Banita Jacks.

Those paying respects included Mayor Adrian M. Fenty , who has said the city missed opportunities to protect the girls, failing to follow up after they stopped attending school early last year. Some family members have sued the city or sent notice of plans to do so.

Fenty expressed condolences to relatives before the funeral began and did not stay for the services. Outside the church, he called the sisters' deaths "one of the greatest tragedies in the history of the District of Columbia" and said he hoped the funeral brings some "closure and healing" to the family.

Days after the bodies were found, Fenty overhauled the child welfare system and fired six workers involved in Jacks case. The mayor also offered at the time to pay for the children's funerals. His spokeswoman, Carrie Brooks , said the city did not pay for the services.

Many of the mourners, including Betty Pollard of Hyattsville, did not know the family. Pollard said she attended the funeral for the children. "I just wanted them to know that someone cared for them," said Pollard, a mother of five and grandmother of seven.

Ann Jackson of Northeast Washington brought two roses that she hoped to place on the caskets. "My heart goes out to these children. They didn't have a chance to start living," said Jackson, a mother of two.

Terilynn Louden, who lived next door to Jacks and her daughters, said she was relieved that the funeral was finally held. "I miss the little girls running up and down the steps," Louden said.

TITLE: Clinton to Suspend Her Campaign on Saturday

Page A01





Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is likely to suspend her presidential campaign on Saturday and endorse Sen. Barack Obama , the Democratic Party 's presumptive nominee, according to informed sources, after a day in which many of her key supporters and party leaders encouraged the senator from New York to make a quick decision in the interest of party unity.



The Clinton campaign issued a statement late yesterday that did not officially confirm her decision but said Clinton would hold an event in Washington "to thank her supporters and express her support for Senator Obama and party unity." The event was originally scheduled for tomorrow, but in a subsequent release her campaign announced that it would be moved to Saturday "to accommodate more of Senator Clinton's supporters who want to attend."

The decision came hours after the launch of an aggressive campaign by some of Clinton's supporters to encourage Obama to pick her as his running mate had further stoked tensions with backers of the senator from Illinois. Robert L. Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television and a prominent Clinton confidant, said in an interview that she was "absolutely ready" to talk to Obama about the No. 2 slot and would take it if offered.

The vice presidential talk and pressure on Clinton to quit the race created an awkward ending to the Democratic race at a time when Obama is eager to turn his attention to the general-election campaign against Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee.

McCain, meanwhile, put his opponent on the spot yesterday with a call for 10 joint town hall meetings at which he and Obama would share the stage and begin a dialogue that would be unprecedented in modern presidential politics.

Although Obama was the newly crowned winner of the Democratic race, the focus remained on Clinton through much of yesterday as Democrats pushed anxiously for her to bring her candidacy to an end.

Even some supporters of Clinton were baffled by the fact that she had still neither endorsed Obama nor announced an intention to continue fighting for the nomination all the way through the Democratic National Convention in August.

Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), one of Clinton's most stalwart supporters, said he would back her efforts to join Obama on the ticket. But, he added, it is incumbent on her to acknowledge she had lost the fight to Obama.

"What I don't know is what the heck she needs this extra time for," he said, referring to Clinton's speech Tuesday, in which she said she would take a few days to consider her options. "How much more time does she need to be able to say the person she wants to help is Barack Obama? I don't know what this intrigue is all about."

Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) and West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin sent out a joint letter urging the remaining uncommitted superdelegates to quickly declare their intentions, though without giving Clinton a timetable for making her decision.

Clinton visited her campaign's Northern Virginia headquarters after speaking to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and told staffers that they would be paid through June 15 but that tomorrow would be their last day of work, leading to speculation that she would drop her candidacy then.

Endorsements for Obama continued rolling in from party officials, senators and House leaders. He was greeted warmly at the AIPAC conference, where sentiments might have tilted against him among audience members wary about the depth of his support for Israel.

TITLE: Clinton Counts on Big Victory in Puerto Rico

Today at The Post Puerto Rico Heads to the Polls

The island of Puerto Rico turns out today for the third-to-last Democratic presidential primary. Anne E. Kornblut and Shailagh Murray set the stage :SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, May 31 -- Almost five months after the Democratic campaign season officially began on a freezing Tuesday in Iowa, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) appears headed toward a last easy victory here today in a contest that has been largely overshadowed by the efforts of party officials to bring the nominating process to an orderly close.... 
Clinton continued to focus on Puerto Rico in the hope that it would move her closer to securing a victory in the overall popular vote in the primary season. She spent Saturday on a presumptive victory lap around the island's capital, leading a caravan through neighborhoods on a flatbed truck blaring music.
"Campaigning in Puerto Rico is like one long Puerto Rican Day Parade," Clinton said at one stop, referring to the annual celebration in New York City. "It is incredibly energizing, exciting."
Puerto Rico will award 55 pledged delegates, not enough to put Clinton within striking distance of Obama, who made his only visit to the island last weekend. Instead, Clinton is hoping to add her share of the 500,000 or so likely voters to her popular-vote total and to assert that she is now in close enough range for uncommitted superdelegates to consider choosing her. The final two states with primaries on Tuesday have far fewer delegates at stake -- 15 in South Dakota and 16 in Montana -- and both appear to favor Obama.

Barack Obama, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, after a day in which many of her key supporters and party leaders encouraged the senator from New York to make a quick decision in the interest of party unity.

TITLE: Social Networking's Disconnect


TEXT:






By Peter Whoriskey
Washington Post Staff Writer

Tuesday, June 3, 2008;
Page D01





Google's announcement of a service to "make the Web more social" was decidedly casual, or staged to seem that way.



Standing beside a campfire, lawn chairs and toasted marshmallows, engineering director David Glazer explained how, through an agreement with Facebook and similar sites, Google's effort would serve a primal human need.

"We all like huddling around fires, and huddling around food and talking to each other -- people are social," Glazer, dressed in a red-checked shirt and sneakers, told about 100 attendees gathered outside the company's headquarters last month. "With 'Friend Connect' we are trying to make that happen everywhere on the Web."

Yet within three days of the campfire, a dispute erupted between Google and Facebook, its largest partner in the new service, that reflected the fact that for Web companies there is nothing casual about the business of Internet socializing: There's too much money, maybe billions, at stake.

Facebook, the burgeoning social network, abruptly withdrew its support for Google's Friend Connect, meaning that none of Facebook's tens of millions of members could sign in to Web sites using Google's new service.

Coming so soon after the highly publicized launch, it was an embarrassing rift for both sides. Many view the ongoing standoff as a contest with far-reaching implications for Web socializing.

In the common social networks, people communicate, organize and socialize largely within sites -- such as Facebook, MySpace or LinkedIn -- but not outside of them. This model, referred to in geek parlance as the "walled garden," ensures that social networking sites get immense traffic and screen time from members, and the revenue that comes with that.

Many in the industry are proposing a different model, however, in which every Web site will have a social aspect. In this scenario, there will be no need for a person to confine socializing to MySpace or Facebook. People could tap into their information -- contacts and pictures -- as they roam the Web. The social networking sites would function more like a utility, storing a person's contacts, photographs and other tidbits.

"Social networking sites are at a major fork in the road," said Bernard Lunn, a tech and media entrepreneur who writes for ReadWriteWeb, a blog that focuses on tech issues.

Although it's uncertain what shape social networks will take, there is little doubt that they have become wildly popular and that their value has been the subject of high-stakes financial speculation.

In 2005, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. bought the company that owned MySpace for $580 million. Last year, Microsoft bought a 1.6 percent stake in Facebook for $240 million, a purchase that valued the three-and-half-year-old company at $15 billion.

But while there are millions willing to spend time updating their pictures and profile information on social network sites, there may be just as many wondering: What good are they?

TITLE: Celtics Advance to Finals


TEXT:






By Michael Wilbon
Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, May 31, 2008;
Page E01





AUBURN HILLS, Mich., May 30 -- The Boston Celtics were 1-7 on the road in the playoffs when they took the court here Friday night for Game 6. But they were able to win not only their second road game of the playoffs, but come from behind in the fourth quarter to beat the Detroit Pistons and reach the NBA Finals in the process.





"It's kind of surreal," Boston's Kevin Garnett said. "Probably hasn't even hit me yet because we haven't slept in about four days, going on five days now. Going to the Finals, I'm just hoping to get some sleep."

The Celtics demonstrated a tenacity on the road unlike their previous road games this postseason. They managed to defeat the Pistons, 89-81, and in doing so joined the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals, which will begin Thursday in Boston.

It's the championship series so many basketball fans -- outside of Detroit and San Antonio -- have been hoping for since the playoffs began in mid-April. It will match two franchises that have won 30 of the NBA's 61 league championships. It also will feature plenty of star power, from Kobe Bryant , Phil Jackson and Pau Gasol with the Lakers, to Boston's Big Three of Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce .

"We're emotionally drained," Garnett said.

Pierce, who outdueled LeBron James in the Celtics' clinching victory over Cleveland in their previous series, led Boston with 27 points. Allen added 17 and Garnett 16.

The Celtics survived a desperate Pistons team, outscoring Detroit 29-13 in the fourth quarter after trailing 68-60 entering the period.

"It was the best fourth quarter we played all playoff long," Pierce said.

The Pistons got early offensive contributions from their battered back court of Chauncey Billups (29 points) and Richard Hamilton (21).

The Celtics held a 29-25 lead 15 minutes into the game primarily because Allen hit five of his eight shots, including 3 of 4 three-pointers for 13 points. Hamilton was playing tight defense on Allen but it didn't seem to matter. And it's not like Allen's points were a luxury, not with Garnett missing eight of his first 10 shots.

When the playoffs began, Garnett and Pierce, each all-stars multiple times, told ESPN they would favor Allen having the last shot in a critical playoff game on the line. But the worst shooting stretch of Allen's career led to intense questioning as to whether Allen, 32, could still light it up as he had for so many years.

Allen, after scoring 29 points in Boston to lead the Celtics in Game 5 and hitting those threes to stake his team to an early lead in Game 6, looked like himself again. Neither team shot 40 percent in the first half, so points were at a premium. The Celtics held the lead at intermission, 40-37, but the Pistons relied entirely the first 24 minutes on Hamilton and Billups, who combined to score 31 of the team's 37 points.

"This is really tough," Billups said. "We had it, and we didn't get over the hump."

The eye-opening news from the first half was that Rasheed Wallace failed to score a single point, going 0 for 5, and Garnett had four points and one measly rebound. Garnett's frustration might have gotten the best of him early in the third quarter, when he was called for a foul while shoving and trading meaningless elbows with Wallace.

Seconds later, Wallace picked up his fourth foul as well. There was irony in the fact that the two of them had annoyed some of their teammates at the end of Game 5 by engaging in a hug on the court. Pistons veterans Hamilton and Lindsey Hunter were particularly pointed in their criticism of Wallace for fraternizing with the enemy.

The Pistons actually appeared to be better with Wallace on the bench. Tayshaun Prince , who was 0 for 5, scored the moment Wallace took a seat and Billups followed with a three-pointer that tied the game after Detroit had fallen behind by five midway through the third quarter. Suddenly, the Pistons were playing both smarter and harder than the Celtics.

Rajon Rondo was being so decisively outplayed by Billups that Boston Coach Doc Rivers had no choice but to bench his young playmaking guard the final four minutes of the third quarter, by which time Billups had scored 24 points. It wasn't just that Rondo wasn't scoring (3-of-9 shooting) but he was making one lousy decision after another with the basketball, putting the Celtics in a position they didn't want to have to overcome late in such a critical game.

"It was probably the best thing because now we can say we have gone through some stuff and we're still standing," Rivers said.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

TITLE: India Sharply Raises Fuel Prices


TEXT:






By Rama Lakshmi
Washington Post Foreign Service

Thursday, June 5, 2008;
Page A13





NEW DELHI, June 4 -- With inflation soaring, the Indian government Wednesday announced the highest ever increase in retail fuel prices, triggering bitter political criticism and angry street protests.



After weeks of nervous caution, the petroleum minister said at a news conference that gasoline prices would rise by the equivalent of 55 cents per gallon, about 11 percent, and diesel by 32 cents, almost 10 percent, effective at midnight. The price of cooking gas cylinders is to rise by a little over a dollar, or about 16 percent. Fuel has traditionally been heavily subsidized by the government, which regulates prices to ease the impact on India's millions of poor.

In a televised address, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the decision was inevitable and that Indians must "learn to adjust" to international economic conditions.

"There are limits to which we can keep consumer prices unaffected by rising import prices," Singh said somberly. "I know that the price increases we have had to announce today will not be popular, even though they are only modest. We remain dependent on imports. We are, therefore, vulnerable to global trends in oil prices."

The government will reduce import and excise taxes to soften the impact of rising oil costs on state-run refiners and oil marketing companies, which have been posting losses of about $1 billion a week.

"Our oil companies cannot go on incurring losses," Singh said. The government also promised oil bonds worth $22 billion to help compensate for below-market sales.

"We are helpless," Petroleum Minister Murli Deora said earlier Wednesday, calling the price hikes "the only option available."

Malaysia, meanwhile, announced a 40 percent increase in gasoline prices, effective Thursday.

In India, the response to the price hikes was both immediate and predictable. In several northern cities, protesters carried placards through the streets, shouting slogans and burning effigies.

In the past three months, inflation has surged to an annual rate of 8.1 percent, the highest since 2004, especially affecting milk, vegetables and cooking oil. The hike in the price of diesel, the country's preferred auto fuel, will further push up commodity prices. India imports more than two-thirds of its oil and is one of Asia's booming economies, growing at over 8 percent a year.

"This is a black day for us. This is an economic terror unleashed on the people of this country," said Rajiv Pratap Rudy, spokesman for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party . "This will amount to an upheaval in the nation."

The criticism also came from allies in Singh's ruling federal coalition. The group of communist parties that back the government threatened to launch a week of nationwide street demonstrations, strikes and blockades of rail and road traffic. The government relies on the support of 59 lawmakers in communist parties.

The price hikes come during a busy political season in India, with four states going to the polls in November and the national elections scheduled for May 2009.

A statement by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said it would "register the people's protest against this unjustified burden" and urged an immediate government review of the increases.

"The price hike is on expected lines and was unavoidable," said K.V. Kamath, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, in a statement. He said the government was presented with a tough balancing act and called for long-term energy-efficiency strategies.

For many Indian families, however, there will be tough decisions and belt-tightening in the kitchen. Pushpa Tanwar, 27, lives in an extended family of eight in a semirural area on the outskirts of the capital. She uses one cooking gas cylinder per month.

"I was already coping with the rising prices of food and milk. Now I will have to conserve my cooking gas too," she said, adding that she would rely more on dried cow dung to fuel a mud stove. Such stoves, used in many poorer Indian homes, cough up poisonous smoke in unvented kitchens.

"It takes longer to cook on the mud stove, but I have no other choice," Tanwar said. "I will use the cooking gas cylinder only for special guests."

TITLE: Ex-Officer Sentenced to 45 Years


TEXT:






By Ruben Castaneda
Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, May 28, 2008;
Page A01





Former Prince George's County homeland security official Keith A. Washington was sentenced to 45 years in prison yesterday for fatally shooting one unarmed furniture deliveryman and wounding another at his Accokeek home last year.





Circuit Court Judge Michael P. Whalen said the evidence contradicted Washington's claim that he was under attack by the two larger men when he opened fire. "There wasn't one discernible injury [on Washington] to any of the medical personnel who examined him," said the judge, who imposed a term five years longer than prosecutors had sought.

Washington, who was also a county police officer at the time of the shooting, addressed the court for more than 10 minutes, apologizing to his family and friends for putting them through what he called a "spectacle." He spoke of his effort to live with "courage and integrity," and he cited historical figures, including Sojourner Truth, W.E.B. DuBois, Crispus Attucks, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington .

Washington, 46, admitted no wrongdoing. At one point, he turned to Marilynn Clark, mother of slain deliveryman Brandon Clark , and said, "I did not murder your son."

"I feel your pain," he said. "No parent should ever have to bury a child. . . . I don't want you to go away thinking some monster shot your son and is indifferent to his death."

Turning to Robert White , the surviving deliveryman, Washington said, "I want you to know, Mr. White, I have no animosity towards you. I feel your pain also."

Later, as Washington was led out of the courtroom, he appeared to mouth the words "I'm okay" to his wife, Stacey Washington, and their daughter.

Stacey Washington said after the hearing: "Keith Washington is now and will forever be my hero. I saw what happened. I saw him being beaten. He is a protector and a defender."

Washington's lawyers, who had requested that he be given a five-year term, declined to comment.

State's Attorney Glenn F. Ivey said he thought the sentence was appropriate. He said Washington opened fire "basically because furniture was delivered late."

Clark and White were at Washington's home in Accokeek on Jan. 24, 2007, to swap one set of Marlo Furniture bed rails for another. An argument broke out between the men and Washington, who opened fire. Clark, 22, died nine days later. White, 37, was wounded.

During the trial in February, White testified that he and Clark did nothing to provoke the shooting. He said Washington, already angry that he had been waiting all day for the delivery, became enraged when Clark asked why the original set of bed rails wasn't dismantled. Washington replied, "[Expletive], you telling me what to do in my house?" White testified.









White said that he suggested he and Clark leave and that he got between Clark and Washington. He testified that Washington said, "I know how to get you the [expletive] out of my house."

Several months after the shooting, Washington left his homeland security post, and he was later granted medical disability from the police force. His disability benefits and police pension are not affected by his convictions, county spokesman John Erzen said.

The case has drawn attention in part because of past abuse allegations against Washington and because of his ties to County Executive Jack B. Johnson (D). Washington was a driver for Johnson during the 2002 campaign, and Johnson named him deputy director of homeland security two years later. The two are members of the same college fraternity, Omega Psi Phi.

After the shooting, Johnson distanced himself from Washington. "We are not friends," he said at one point. He also said that he "never promoted" Washington, despite having given him the homeland security position.

Yesterday, at a news conference, Marilynn Clark said of Washington's remarks in court, "I didn't want to hear it."

White said he accepted Washington's apology. "Justice has prevailed," White said.

During the four-hour sentencing hearing, Whalen also heard testimony about an incident in March in which correctional officers found a handcuff key in the breast pocket of Washington's orange jumpsuit shortly before he was to be transferred to the Calvert County jail.

Lt. Avery Johnson of the county corrections department testified that Washington provided two explanations for the key. In one version, Johnson said, Washington said he found it on the windowsill of his cell. In another version, Washington said the key was "planted," Johnson said. Corrections investigators have not determined how Washington got the key, Johnson said.

Also yesterday, Daniel Smart, a retired county police sergeant, testified about an incident years ago in which Washington became enraged at Smart's request that he drive an intoxicated man from a scene where officers were arresting drug dealing suspects. Washington went "from zero to 100, with nothing in between," Smart said.

The 45-year sentence is high for people convicted of the offenses of which Washington was found guilty: involuntary manslaughter, two counts of first-degree assault and two handgun violations. A jury acquitted him of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder.

In court, Whalen said that Washington had put his police handgun inside the waistband of his jeans in anticipation of the furniture deliverymen's arrival. Whalen said White and Clark had begun working at 6 a.m. that day and had made numerous deliveries without incident.

Finally, Whalen said, Washington's voice in court yesterday -- when he struggled to maintain his composure -- was far different from that of the "very composed man" who told a 911 operator on the night of the shootings that he had been beaten.

Yesterday, as Washington was preparing to leave the Calvert County Detention Center, officers found that he had two binder clips and a paper clip, which are not allowed under jail rules, said Calvert Sheriff Mike Evans (R).

Evans said he did not know how Washington obtained the materials, which can be used to create weapons or pick locks, and Washington offered officers no explanation about how he got them. Evans said Washington might have picked them up from a table after meeting with his lawyers.

"You can assume all sorts of things, but who knows?" Evans said. "He's got a history of trying to do something sneaky."

TITLE: Celtics Defeat Lakers, 98-88


TEXT:

Washington Post Staff Writer

Friday, June 6, 2008;
Page E01





BOSTON, June 5 -- At one end of the floor, Boston Celtics forward P.J. Brown missed a jumper, and Rajon Rondo missed a rebound tip near the basket. On the other end, few seemed to notice or care. Fans at TD Banknorth Garden started rising from their seats and applauding the only occurrence that mattered for their championship hopes: Paul Pierce was walking, better yet bouncing, better still, about to return to the game.





Only a few minutes before, Pierce couldn't even walk off the floor under his own power, after a nasty collision with teammate Kendrick Perkins . He made a tearful exit on the arms of teammates Brian Scalabrine and Tony Allen .

When Pierce finally made his way back to the sideline midway in the third quarter, wearing a black brace on his knee, he patted teammate Tony Allen on the chest. "He told me, 'I'm back, let's ride,' " Allen said.

Pierce scored 11 of his 22 points in the final 17 minutes, lifting the Celtics to a 98-88 win over the Los Angeles Lakers for a 1-0 lead in the NBA Finals . In doing so, he added another chapter to the 11th installment of this storied rivalry.

"He was walking, he was up on his own strength, and he rejuvenated us to the point that he gave us life," said Celtics forward Kevin Garnett , who had game highs with 24 points and 13 rebounds.

Garnett gave the Celtics a lift of his own as Boston finally kept the Lakers and league most valuable player Kobe Bryant at bay with a forceful dunk of a James Posey miss with 90 seconds left. The basket gave Boston an eight-point lead, and went on a long way in fulfilling the fans' ongoing chants "Beat L.A.!"

Bryant also scored 24 points, but he didn't have many easy or uncontested looks. He missed 17 of his 26 field goal attempts, as the Celtics, and their top ranked defense, held the Lakers to just 15 points in the fourth quarter.

The Lakers are 1-2 this postseason when they fail to score at least 90 points.

"I had some great looks," Bryant said. "They just didn't stay down. It was just pile it in with the other bad games I've had and flush it."

Pierce, the longest tenured Celtic and in his 10th season, had always wanted to lead Boston back to the Finals. But after the team suffered through a miserable 24-win campaign last season, Pierce thought he was going to be traded until the Celtics landed Garnett and Ray Allen in offseason deals.

The Celtics pulled off the greatest turnaround in NBA history, and finally brought the Finals to this city for the first time in 21 years -- a drought so long that Lakers center Andrew Bynum hadn't been born yet. But in Pierce's long-awaited Finals debut got off to an inauspicious start, as he picked up three fouls in the first half and had to sit while his team turned a five-point lead into a five-point deficit at the break.

Pierce quickly got the Celtics going in the second half, as he scored the first six points of the third quarter, the last of which came on an improbable four-point play. Pierce pump faked to get Vladimir Radmanovic off his feet to draw a foul, then banked a three-pointer from the right elbow extended to give the Celtics a 52-51 lead.

Bryant brought back his team and gave it a 62-58 lead with a baseline jumper over Pierce with 6:52 remaining in the third. When Pierce landed, Perkins stepped on Pierce's foot and Pierce twisted his leg before falling. Pierce was writhing on the floor in pain, grabbing his left knee. Fans starting chanting, "Let's go Paul."

Pierce tried but couldn't stand up. Scalabrine and Tony Allen carried Pierce toward the locker room, as Pierce covered his face, seemingly rubbing away tears.

"I was like, man, it can't be over like this," Pierce said. "I think God just sent this angel down and said, 'Hey, you're going to be all right. You need to get out there. Show them what you've got.' "

He came back, in a scene reminiscent of former New York Knick Willis Reed 's triumphant comeback against the Lakers in 1970, dancing side-to-side and the sellout crowd went wild. Some even chanted Reed's name. They got especially loud when Pierce nailed back-to-back three-pointers to give the Celtics a 75-71 lead.

"Guys can break a shoelace and go out. The pants break down, drawstrings fall apart. You don't know what happens to guys," Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said about Pierce's injury. "Pierce was back on the floor in three minutes, so he wasn't that long out of the game. He came back and hit two threes. I think that was a big momentum change in the game."

"It's been a long wait," Celtics Coach Doc Rivers said of Pierce. "I don't think he wants to get here and then sit on the sidelines. A guy grabs his knee, you know, there's no good thoughts. We could have easily felt sorry for ourselves. Obviously, him coming back lifted us up."

TITLE: More Than Just Votes at Stake

Washington Post Staff Writer

Page B01





Winning Northern Virginia's increasingly blue-tilting 11th Congressional District was supposed to be one of the easier feats for Democrats trying to widen their majorities in Congress this year. But a competitive four-way primary battle has become so nasty that victory for the seat could come at a steep price: party unity.





Most of the sharp words have been exchanged between the two leading candidates, former congresswoman Leslie L. Byrne and Gerald E. Connolly , chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. Byrne has called Connolly a war profiteer and a "pay-to-play" special-interest politician. Connolly has called Byrne a liar willing to stop at nothing to secure the nomination.

The attacks could sully more than the candidates' images. Two of the state's leading Democrats are involved. Gov. Timothy M. Kaine has endorsed Connolly, and U.S. Sen. James Webb has endorsed Byrne. Even former governor Mark R. Warner , who is running for the U.S. Senate , has been dragged in. In a recent mailing, Connolly accused Byrne of calling Warner a rat and a racist after she lost a U.S. Senate primary to him 12 years ago.

The tenor of the 11th District race threatens Democratic unity at a time when the state party is stronger than it has been in years. Virginia is viewed as a potential presidential battleground for the first time in 44 years. Warner is viewed as the heavy favorite to replace retiring U.S. Sen. John W. Warner (R) . Kaine, Webb and Warner have been mentioned as possible vice presidential picks for Sen. Barack Obama .

At a time when Democratic resolve is needed most -- to elect a Democrat to the White House and Warner to the Senate -- the party could be pulled apart in a district that should be a base of support.

"I do worry a little bit about the tone of the campaign, and there's no reason it has to be that way," Kaine said in a recent interview. "It's easy to sit on the sidelines and say, 'Oh, I wish it could be a little more positive,' and I recognize that. But both candidates have positive records to sell. They don't need to tear each other down."

In addition to Connolly and Byrne, former Navy fighter pilot Doug Denneny and physical therapist Lori P. Alexander are vying for the Democratic nomination to succeed retiring U.S. Rep. Tom Davis (R). The winner will face Republican Keith Fimian, a wealthy businessman promoted by Davis, who has contributed financially to Fimian's campaign.

Kaine and Webb are closer to the fray because they chose to make endorsements. Webb endorsed Byrne in part because Byrne was one of the first Democrats to support Webb in his 2006 bid for the Senate. And Kaine chose Connolly in part to level the playing field and because, as a former mayor of Richmond, he has worked closely with Connolly on local government issues, he said.

Webb said he thinks either candidate would do well in Congress. "Either of these people is better than what's there at the moment," Webb said. "There's going to be plenty of time between now and November to mend those fences."

In part because of an early fundraising advantage and because he spent $1 million persuading voters to reelect him as Fairfax board chairman last fall, Connolly has been widely viewed as the favorite going into the June 10 primary. Byrne has closed the financial gap, and the two candidates have roughly the same amount of cash.

But on the issues, Connolly and Byrne (who is better funded and better known than the other two contenders) are not very far apart. Both oppose the war in Iraq and are deeply critical of President Bush 's leadership. Both seek improvements to the nation's health-care system, better environmental stewardship and more wage protection and other relief for the working class.

Those similarities created a ripe environment for a negative campaign. Connolly has said repeatedly that the primary would hinge on "electability," meaning that an examination of candidates' relationships and past performances at the polls would be in order (Connolly regularly notes that he has not lost in five elections, but Byrne has lost three).

TITLE: Winning Strategy Was Based On Delegates


TEXT:






By Jonathan Weisman, Shailagh Murray and Peter Slevin
Washington Post Staff Writers

Wednesday, June 4, 2008;
Page A01





Almost from the beginning, Hillary Rodham Clinton 's superior name recognition and her sway with state party organizations convinced Barack Obama 's brain trust that a junior senator from Illinois was not going to be able to challenge the Clinton political machine head-on.





The insurgent strategy the group devised instead was to virtually cede the most important battlegrounds of the Democratic nomination fight to Clinton, using precision targeting to minimize her delegate hauls, while going all out to crush her in states where Democratic candidates rarely ventured.

The result may have lacked the glamour of a sweep, but last night, with the delegates he picked up in Montana and South Dakota and a flood of superdelegate endorsements, Obama sealed one of the biggest upsets in U.S. political history and became the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter to wrest his party's nomination from the candidate of the party establishment. The surprise was how well his strategy held up -- and how little resistance it met.

"We kept waiting for the Clinton people to send people into the caucus states," marveled Jon Carson, one of Obama's top ground-game strategists.

"It's the big mystery of the campaign," said campaign manager David Plouffe , "because every delegate counts."

The Obama strategy had its limits. Like a basketball team entering halftime with a 30-point lead, the campaign played a less-than-inspired second half. Obama managed only a split yesterday, losing South Dakota and winning Montana, meaning that he lost nine of the last 14 primaries. Before last night, that erratic finish translated into losing 458 of the 867 pledged delegates available since Wisconsin voted on Feb. 19, and 53.2 percent of the popular vote.

His inability to capture battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania may be a portent of what could await him in November against Sen. John McCain . But victory did come -- not in a rush of momentum but in what his own staff calls a "slog."

"Here's a person who nobody had heard of. The nomination was Hillary Clinton's. She was being coronated 16 months ago," said former congressman Timothy J. Roemer, who helped turn Indiana into a narrow defeat that worked to Obama's favor. "He's gone through a long, gut-wrenching, difficult process and emerged as a very talented, tough candidate."

When Obama began his campaign in early 2007, the road ahead was a fairly conventional one, not unlike the one followed by Gary Hart or Bill Bradley before him: Battle for the first three or four states and momentum steamrolls the opponent.

"We had to disrupt her early," Plouffe said of Clinton.

Super Tuesday on Feb. 5 loomed like a mountain. Obama's campaign had budgeted a mere $5 million for that day, and the Democrats had 22 states at stake, including prohibitively expensive prizes such as California and New York.

But by last summer, after Obama's wildly successful book tour led to an even more wildly successful fundraising blitz, members of his inner circle began thinking differently. They began building a new strategy based on message, money and, above all, organization.

TITLE: Treaty Bans Cluster Bombs


TEXT:






By Kevin Sullivan and Josh White
Washington Post Foreign Service

Thursday, May 29, 2008;
Page A01





LONDON, May 28 -- More than 100 countries reached agreement Wednesday to ban cluster bombs, controversial weapons that human rights groups deplore but which the United States, which did not join the ban, calls an integral, legitimate part of its arsenal.





British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , whose personal intervention Wednesday led to final agreement among representatives of 111 countries gathered in Dublin, called the ban a "big step forward to make the world a safer place."

In addition to the United States, Russia , China , Israel , India and Pakistan -- all of them major producers or users of the weapons -- did not sign the agreement or participate in the talks.

The weapons consist of canisters packed with small bombs, or "bomblets," that spread over a large area when dropped from a plane or fired from the ground. While the devices are designed to explode on impact, they frequently do not. Civilians, particularly children, are often maimed or killed when they pick up unexploded bombs, sometimes years later.

In staying away from Dublin, U.S officials argued that the talks were not the right forum in which to address the issue and that cluster bombs remain an important part of the country's weaponry. "While the United States shares the humanitarian concerns of those in Dublin," said Navy Cmdr. Bob Mehal, a Pentagon spokesman, "cluster munitions have demonstrated military utility, and their elimination from U.S. stockpiles would put the lives of our soldiers and those of our coalition partners at risk."

The U.S. military says that it keeps the weapons in its arsenal as a defense against advancing armies, a strategy closely linked to conventional Cold War approaches to conflict, and that it has not used the bombs since the 2003 invasion of Iraq . U.S. officials argue that technological advances will ensure that future cluster bombs reliably explode or quickly disable themselves, so they will not be a hazard to civilians later.

Israel carried out the largest recent use of cluster bombs, dropping large numbers on southern Lebanon in its 2006 war with Hezbollah militiamen. Many of the bombs did not explode immediately and have left a lasting humanitarian hazard.

Advocates of the ban said they hope the agreement, which was supported by rich nations and poor from Scandinavia to Africa, will have the same effect as the 1997 ban on land mines, reducing use even among non-signatory countries.

Simon Conway, co-chair of the Cluster Munitions Coalition, said that Burma is the only nation still using land mines and that the United States has not fired a single one since the ban went into effect.

Already, controversy over cluster bombs has led the United States to stop exporting them for now -- a law that went into force this year bars the foreign sale of cluster bombs that have less than a 99 percent detonation or disabling rate, conditions that current versions of the weapons do not meet.

And as a matter of policy, the NATO alliance does not use cluster munitions in Afghanistan .

The Dublin meetings were part of a process begun in February 2007 in Oslo. The nations met again in Lima, Peru, in May 2007; Vienna in December; and Wellington, New Zealand, in January.

TITLE: Exxon Drills for Every Penny


TEXT:






By Steven Mufson
Washington Post Staff Writer

Sunday, May 25, 2008;
Page A01





Every time Sohaila Rezazadeh rings up a sale at her Exxon station on Chain Bridge Road in Oakton, her cash register sends the information to Exxon Mobil 's central computers. If she raises the price of gasoline a couple of pennies, chances are that Exxon will raise the wholesale price she pays by the same amount.



Through a password-protected Web portal, Exxon notifies Rezazadeh of wholesale price changes daily. That way the oil giant, which is earning about $3.3 billion a month, fine-tunes the pump prices at the franchise Rezazadeh has owned for 12 years.

Now, however, Rezazadeh says she cannot stay in business. Credit-card fees are eating her profit margins. Exxon, which owns the station land, last week handed Rezazadeh a new lease raising her rent about 30 percent over the next three years. She stuck a copy on the window of her station to show customers who are angry about soaring pump prices. Rezazadeh has told Exxon that she cannot make money with the rent that high. Her territory manager's reply, she said, was simple: When you go, leave us the keys.

Rezazadeh, who fled to the United States from Iran in 1979, is part of the long chain that links motorists with the big oil companies. Major integrated U.S. oil companies -- which produce crude oil, own refineries and sell gasoline -- have been reaping billions of dollars in profit from high oil prices over the past two years, but they are still working to extract every penny they can from the marketing end of the business. Exxon Mobil doesn't break out its earnings from marketing alone, but its 2007 profits in worldwide refining and marketing -- known as the downstream part of the oil business -- reached $9.6 billion, 43 percent of that coming from the United States.

Although Exxon owns and operates few stations anymore -- less than 10 percent of the 12,000 Exxon outlets in the United States -- it uses franchise agreements to maintain tight control over stations that bear its brand. The company dictates everything from the number of pumps to hygiene practices to the placement of food on convenience store shelves. "They monitor everything," Rezazadeh said.

Exxon says it does all this to maintain uniform quality, while recognizing dealer needs. "We recognize . . . that we are in a difficult time with the run-up in crude oil prices," said Ben Soraci, director of U.S. retail sales for Exxon. "Retailers are under a lot of pressure, and they are on the front lines every day with the motorist, who is also feeling a lot of pressure."

Ultimately, Soraci said, "it's in our interest to see them succeed. It's not in our interest to see them hand us the keys."

But some Exxon dealers say the company is trying to squeeze too much out of them.

Like Rezazadeh, Scott Burnham was struggling to cope with low margins and rising rents. On May 9, he closed his station on scenic Knickerbocker Road in Closter, N.J., and abandoned it to Exxon. In March, Exxon had said it would raise his rent by a third over two years. Burnham tried to line up buyers for the franchise, which he purchased for $475,000 just two years ago. But one backed out, saying that the station would lose money no matter how much gasoline it sold.

"Why is the government giving Exxon subsidies and tax breaks when they're making billions of dollars and when they squeeze every dime they can out of every dealer who made that profit for them?" Burnham said.

Soraci said rent increases reflect rising real estate values. "We have excellent real estate out there that is superior to our competition," he said, which allows the dealers to "compete more effectively."

Even some of Exxon's successful and loyal dealers complain. Jerry Daggle owns five Exxon stations in Northern Virginia, and even though they have different competitive conditions and prices, "Exxon magically lets me make about 8 cents a gallon" at each one, he said.









He said micromanaging extends to the snacks sold at Exxon's On the Run convenience stores. The company uses a "planogram" to show dealers where to put candy bars and soda. "If I want to put Coke on a different shelf, I have to get special permission," Daggle said. Recently he was reprimanded for selling mulch on the perimeter of his award-winning Gainesville station; the mulch, though popular in the neighborhood, wasn't an approved product.



Technology has enabled Exxon to tweak its wholesale prices not just by region or state, but by zones as small as a street corner. Although such practices bring cries of outrage from some station owners, they elicit shrugs from some economists.

"Retailers put a lot of effort into understanding local markets, whether they're in the airline business where prices for every seat are often determined on daily basis, or book sellers," said Richard J. Gilbert, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley , who has studied the gasoline marketing business. "There's a lot of fine-tuning to adjust prices to local market conditions. The gasoline companies are not very different in that regard."

"We feel very strongly that zone pricing is a method of pricing that at end of the day allows our dealers to be as competitive as they can be at the retail level," Soraci of Exxon said. "It gives us the opportunity to give a particular retailer or trade area a lower price if competitive conditions require that."

Daggle, who has been an Exxon dealer for two decades after working his way up from pumping gas, said he has done well. But he still cannot fathom how the oil company can charge him different wholesale gasoline prices for each of the five Northern Virginia stations he owns. The stations all sell the same Exxon-branded gasoline, delivered from the same terminal in Newington, where it arrives via the same pipeline. Sometimes, Daggle said, it's even dropped off by the same truck and driver hours apart on the same day.

The only thing that's different is the price, which can vary by 35 cents per gallon, Daggle said. "If I could have driven a truck to Gainesville and drive the gas from there to Shirlington, I could have made 50 cents a gallon."

On occasion, he said, he has persuaded Exxon to lower his wholesale price to help match price cuts by a station next door in Gainesville.

Historically, gasoline marketing has been a low-margin business. For decades, when oil was plentiful, margins were kept low to move as much crude oil through the system as possible. Now, major companies don't have to fight to move product, but they are still battling for nickels and dimes at the pumps.

Like other parts of the retailing business, gasoline marketing has become more concentrated and high volume than it was in the days when mom-and-pop gas stations lured customers with free drinking glasses.

Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm, noted in a report that in 1977, the United States had 223,118 gasoline outlets. By 2007, the number of outlets had declined to 164,292 -- even as the amount of gasoline sold increased. The average station now pumps 73 percent more than in 1977. And companies are trying to boost revenues by attaching convenience stores to the stations. In 1977, only 5 percent of gas stations had convenience stores; now, 65 percent do.

"The industry we're part of is an extremely competitive industry," said Exxon's Soraci. He said major oil companies' market share has dropped 20 percent in recent years as mass merchandisers such as Costco vie for customers.

Oddly enough, when prices are rising rapidly and consumers are most upset is usually when profit margins are slimmest for station owners. When prices are falling, as they were in September 2006, is usually when jobbers and station owners make the most money.

How much depends largely on Exxon. "If I had raised my gas, within a couple of days, almost inevitably, they would have raised my wholesale price. It's an unspoken rule," Daggle said. He said his Gainesville station makes most of its money from repairs, not gas sales.

Selling gas remains a cutthroat business in an industry awash in profits. Three years ago, when Daggle bought the Gainesville station, a share of Exxon stock was about $50. Buying and fixing up the station has cost him $800,000, and he hasn't yet drawn a profit from it. "If I had bought the stock," he said, he would have nearly doubled his money and would have "never lifted a finger."

TITLE: Book Review: Matthew Yglesias's "Head in the Sand"


TEXT:

Book Review: Matthew Yglesias's "Head in the Sand" by SusanG Sun Jun 01, 2008 at 10:10:37 AM PDT
Heads in the Sand: How the Republicans Screw Up Foreign Policy and Foreign Policy Screws Up the Democrats By Matthew Yglesias John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Hoboken, NJ: 2008 272 pages, $25.95
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are the central event of the contemporary politics of national security, and the sense that traditional internationalism is somehow inadequate to the challenges in this area has been the crux of its eclipse.
Nevertheless, this perception, no matter how widely held, is essentially false.
...
Liberals seek reciprocal reductions in national sovereignty wherein every nation commits to abide by certain standards in the fields of human rights, proliferation, environmental protection, and so on. An isolationist would let each country go its own way. The Bush model, in contrast to these, but in echo of the imperialist tradition, seeks an asymmetrical sovereignty wherein the United States is unencumbered by rules, while seeking to impose them on others. 
Somewhere between the two extremes of Ron Paul/Charles Lindbergh brand of isolationism and the neoconservative dream of militant American imperialism lies the sweet spot of responsible engagement with the world, and blogger wunderkind Matthew Yglesias sets out to find it and define it in Heads in the Sand . While the subtitle faults both political parties for screwing up the journey to that magical foreign policy mecca, the book itself is forward-looking, more addressed to recently empowered (and future empowered) Democrats, even as it takes the obligatory swipes at the disasters of Republican foreign policy over the past eight years. Been there, done that ... the author moves us on to examining why the opposition party has refused to be oppositional and why, exactly, it has failed to advance a strong argument for what Yglesias calls "liberal internationalism"--the credo that served America well for decades before 9/11 came along and everyone in power seemed to lose their minds, their perspective and their sense of history.
Yglesias traces the lineage of modern-day liberal internationalism from its father, Woodrow Wilson, down through the ages to today, with a long stop at Truman--for Truman, it seems, is often the lodestone that the neocons point to when they claim to be the true heirs to America's role of leadership in the world. While it's true that Truman's willingness to drop the bomb lends itself well to the fever dreams of Perle & Company quite conveniently, there was a lot more than a big, big bomb and decisiveness to Truman's actions. Yglesias rightly argues that lifting actions out of the contexts of their times is a poor way to use any sort of guide at all, and that America's most enlightened presidents have managed to keep the nation safe. After all,  even before "terrorism" got its sleek new creds and name as the bogeyman of the new century, it's been hanging around in the form of non-state actors "terrorizing" states and their agents for a couple of centuries. Somehow, we managed to muddle along with a wide-angle view of the world and scads more respect from other countries without resorting, as Yglesias notes, to a one-trick-pony paranoia: :: 
Internationalists were able, moreover, to make counterterrorism a high-level security policy without making a "war on terror" the organizing principle of U.S. foreign policy. Rather, the main goal remained what it long had been: to continue to extend the effort launched by Roosevelt and Truman to bring Wilson's vision of a liberal world order closer and closer to reality.
In such a world, citizens of different countries would meet each other through commerce, tourism, and the global communications network, not as soldiers on the fields of battle. Governments would interact through diplomacy, arbitration, and international institutions, rather than through threats of force. Fighting terrorism, the visible and immediately deadly threat to this vision, was a necessary and vital task but not, itself, the animating idea of national policy. 
In Yglesias's telling, while the neocons seized the opportunity to impose the views of military imperialism upon the nation, in hindsight, one can spot the trail leading up to having such a view of America take hold, despite previous vigorous public rejections of such a role. Liberal war hawks have been with us for half a century, urging a muscular spread of democracy for reputedly humanitarian reasons (indeed, Yglesias calls Clinton's intervention in Somalia and Yugoslavia "humanitarian militarism"). The author rightly notes that to those not paying attention--or those keeping score of action and not rhetoric--the end results can look the same, whether one is arguing from a a stance of neocon American exceptionalism or from the liberal humanitarian model:
To act in the manner suggested by the most committed interventionists would require the United States to essentially proclaim itself above the rules of the international system--free to attack any country that we deemed unworthy. The advocates of such policies fancied their commitment to humanitarian ends a crucial distinguishing factor from the unilateral nationalists of the right, but from a structural perspective their claims were essentially identical. 
No less odd than the bed-sharing of left-wing humanitarian interventionists and right-wing imperialists is the bunking up together of conservative isolationists and lefty pacifists; non-intervention, Yglesias points out, has the same result on the subject country whether one is Pat Buchanan or the Dalia Lama. But there is a world of difference in the political philosophy that takes such circuituous routes to the same destination (a distinction lost on supposed liberal Ron Paul supporters to this day). Similarly, the world's largest military under Clinton is still the world's largest military under Bush, with the twist, as Yglesias notes, that "Bush simply wants a powerful military but wants it to do less humanitarian work."
Liberals were unable to clearly articulate to the American people a broader view of foreign policy beyond "invade and kill" in the wake of 9/11 for several reasons: the reign of the war hawks within the Democratic Party, the fear of non-hawks to be seen as weak, the feeling of panic, and a general muddle-headedness about foreign policy in general on the part of Democrats, most of whom (if they're not hawks) long ago surrendered the realm of international relations to the Republican Party, preferring to focus on bread-and-butter domestic issues (obviously, this emphasis has changed in the past eight years). Additionally, the wrong lessons learned under the Clinton administration lingered. Yglesias remarks, "What the liberal hawks had learned from Bosnia was not a doctrine about the use of force or the role of human rights in foreign policy, but a kind of disdain for the aesthetics of antiwar politics." More problematically, they also naively underestimated the determination of the neocons to take control of the situation and drive it to their own ends:
The extent to which Democratic willingness to use force in the 2002 flowed from a distinctive set of principles, as opposed to being a reflection of generic "hawkishness," went unarticulated. Liberals, by not understanding where their opponents stood, wound up confusing themselves at the worst time--on the eve of a disastrous war underpinned by principles whose existence they barely understood, much less were prepared to criticize. 
In the losing-our-minds phase in the latter half of 2001 and well into 2002, Democrats also seemed bound and determined to be as tough, as mean, as militaristic as Republicans, often making theatrical use of distancing themselves disdainfully from the "loony left"--and often castigating any voice of reason that called for inspection, diplomacy, or even time to think through long-term policy implications of preemptive war. This dismissal, in retrospect, is shameful, and the testeronic posing ridiculous and repellant in hindsight.
... liberal hawks continued with the tradition commenced in late 2001 of treating disagreements with people to their left as more significant than disagreements with those to their right, even though the reins of power were exclusively in the hands of the right. The motivations for taking this stance were complicated, but prominent among them was the illusion of control. Casting one's lot with the antiwar faction meant disavowing any effort to influence the course of national policy. Casting your stance as an argument for war , by contrast, kept you on the team and perhaps in a position where policymakers in positions of actual power might listen to you. 
John Kerry in 2004 tried unsuccessfully to finesse his stands, and the current crop of Democratic candidates early on used each other's public statements and legislative votes to bludgeon each other with, demanding apologies, justifications, reversals, recommitments ... all pointing still, Yglesias would argue, to more attention being paid to the drama of it all than to the substance. Some hard long-term work is called for here, not just in regards to Iraq, but in rethinking America's role in the world in the coming decades. And Yglesias insists--vigorously--that we jettison the notion and the argument that this was a good war, poorly executed. He returns to this point repeatedly throughout the book: America needs to be disabused of this idea of mere bad implementation, or we are doomed to repeat it. Worse, we're doomed to listen to the same salespeople in positions of power pitch us the same lame pro-invasion stands in similar circumstances. Think of Iraq as Groundhog Day with the same talking heads and a different place on the map, over and over and over ....
At a minimum, there's ... no reason to believe that the invasion of Iraq was a good idea ruined by poor implementation, rather than an idea whose execution went badly because the underlying idea was fatally flawed. As such, it fails to provide any questions or issues that may arise. Even worse, its utility to liberal hawks is itself a major problem.
It allows the very people whose dominant position inside progressive circles helped to drive the Democratic Party off the cliff in the first place to retain their positions of influence without substantially modifying their underlying worldview.
This, of course, is an important source of its appeal. It's also the essence of the problem. The incompetence line is a dodge, a way for liberal hawks to acknowledge the grim reality of the war without rethinking any of the premises that led them to support it in the first place. From a narrowly political point of view, this may be adequate to allow Democrats to regain control over U.S. foreign policy, but it offers no assurances that doing so will actually fix any of the main problems the Bush administration has created. 
Any insistence on the "good idea, badly implemented" line of thinking rules out the real places where constructive thinking and policy can take hold. "Improving our ability to execute missions abroad," says Yglesias, "is much less important than improving our strategy for when and why to intervene." And, he complains, "a significant number of people are proposing that we essentially keep doing the same thing, except with a larger army, and hope for better results."
That way, of course, lies madness. Yet pointing this out still gets one labeled as naive and foolhardy in certain circles, even liberal circles still, with devotees of humanitarian militarism still rooting for the spread of democracy. One of the best services Yglesias does in this book is really boiling down the illogic of this entire "spreading democracy at gunpoint" rubric in one succinct paragraph:
... if democracy's spread is inevitable--or even semi-inevitable--then it hardly seems reasonable for the linchpin of the global democratic community to undertake great risks and massive expense to try to spread it to one particular country. If anything, faith in democracy's appeal should encourage a policy of caution , one that takes the view--similar to the containment of the Cold War--that if the world's democracies focus on maintaining their own security, prosperity, and a reasonable degree of unity, authoritarian alternatives will eventually collapse without dramatic invasions. 
This book marks what we can hope is the first of many progressive forays into discovering a new way to be in the world--which just happens to be an old way, updated to the 21st century and unapologetic about viewing military intervention as a final resort.

TITLE: Biden Hits McCain on Spying


TEXT:

Biden Hits McCain on Spying by mcjoan Sat Jun 07, 2008 at 11:15:04 AM PDT
Biden, recognizing a good political opportunity when he sees one, hits McCain hard on warrantless wiretapping :
Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Joe Biden, a former presidential candidate seen as a potential running mate for Barack Obama, has issued a statement regarding John McCain's apparent belief that the practice of wiretapping without warrants is legal....
In his statement, Biden wrote that the FISA statute, which he helped draft, "made clear the exclusive legal steps the President must take in order to conduct national security surveillance."
"President Bush chose to ignore the law and now it seems Senator McCain will continue this policy," Biden writes. "Once again – there is no daylight between President Bush and Sen. McCain."
"We all share the goal of capturing the terrorists and protecting national security and we can do that without violating the privacy of the American people," he added. "Like President Bush, Sen. McCain is presenting the American people with a false choice—national security or civil liberties. We need a President who understands that we can have both. It’s what our values and our Constitution demands." 
Excellent first start. Hopefully more Dems will recognize what a liability the Bush/McCain position on warrantless wiretapping and telco amnesty, and put an end to any talk of "compromise" with the Republicans on this issue.
There's a very simple solution to the warrantless wiretapping debate: Congress can extend the orders that were established last year under the PAA and are set to expire in August for a period of nine months or a year, letting the next administration and Congress resolve the issue. That also gives Obama and the Dems an opportunity over the next five months to demonstrate, just as Biden does, that "there is no daylight between President Bush and Sen. McCain." ::

Half by kos Wed May 28, 2008 at 04:45:23 PM PDT
An early defeat for Clinton on the matter of Florida and Michigan:
Democratic Party lawyers are telling a committee looking at the fate of disputed delegates from Florida and Michigan that they can't restore all of them, the Associated Press is reporting this morning.
The two states must lose at least half of their 368 total delegates for holding their primaries before party rules allowed, the lawyers say in a memo sent late Tuesday to the 30 members of the party's Rules and Bylaws Committee, which plans to meet Saturday in Washington.
The committee can either allow half the number of delegates from each state into the national convention or allow the full delegations to attend, but give them each half a vote, but seating half the delegates is "as far as it legally can" go, the lawyers say, according to the AP.
The lawyers, however, don't suggest how any delegates should be divided between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. 
The Clinton campaign, of course, doesn't like this.
Senior Clinton aides disputed the notion that the DNC lawyers memo requires punishing Florida and Michigan with the loss of at least half their delegates, saying that was only one option available to the rules committee. 
The Clinton campaign won't like anything short of a full seating -- all of Michigan's 128 delegates -- with Obama getting zero delegates out of the Soviet-style, one-candidate election in Michigan. They won't be getting that. ::

Interesting superdelegate observation by kos Mon Jun 02, 2008 at 04:30:18 PM PDT
Blogger Claude Johnson talks to uncommitted superdelegate :
Once we began chatting, I quickly felt that X was looking for a way to declare her support of Senator Obama without running afoul of Bill Clinton. She repeatedly expressed how loyal she was to Bill because he put Democrats on the map, and all he’s done over the years. She was very worried and concerned about loyalty.
She never did mention Hillary Clinton. Only Bill. 
That's a fascinating observation, and I wonder if it's a trait shared by more uncommitted super delegates beyond this sample size of one. Regardless, it's clear that no matter how damaging Bill has been at times this primary season, he's a huge reason she has been so viable and has been able to survive far deeper into the primary process than any mere mortal candidate would've managed.   ::

TITLE: Montana's huge black population gives Obama the edge


TEXT:

Montana's huge black population gives Obama the edge by kos Sun May 25, 2008 at 12:29:02 PM PDT
Census numbers :
Black Persons, 2006 : 0.4% White Persons, 2006 : 90.8%

The rest are either Latino (2.5%) or Native American (6.4%).
Montana is also the nation's fifth poorest state . It's poor, it's white, and has no African Americans to speak of. Therefore, if what the Clinton campaign and its apologists say is correct, if what the political news media tell me is accurate, Clinton should have another 30-point blowout in store. Right?
Mason-Dixon for Lee Newspapers. 5/19-21. Likely Democratic primary voters. MoE 5% (12/17-19 results)
Obama 52 (17) Clinton 35 (29)

I expect the Clinton campaign to spin bullshit. It's been the entirety of their campaign now for several months. But it's shocking to me how difficult it has been for the political media to distinguish from Obama's Appalachian problem and his non-existent problems with white voters at large.
Then again we can always ju jitsu this and ask, "Why is Clinton suddenly having a hard time with working class whites? Are they now abandoning her?" Such a question would be bullshit, of course. Obama has always done very well west of the Mississippi, and Clinton poorly outside of the Latino vote in the southwest. But if they want to deal in bullshit, we can always oblige.
M-D also polled general election matchups, and this state, which Kerry lost by 20 points, is a single-digit affair for Obama.
Mason-Dixon for Lee Newspapers. 5/19-21. Likely Democratic primary voters. MoE 4% (No trend lines)
             Total  Men  Wom   Rep   Dem   Ind McCain  (R)   47    50   44    85    12    39 Obama   (D)   39    37   41     4    77    41
McCain  (R)   51    48   48    91     7    50 Clinton (D)   40    38   42     2    88    33

There's an obvious typo there -- McCain can't be winning both women and men with 48 percent of the vote, and overall 51-40. Regardless, once Obama brings home Democrats to Clinton-like levels, it'll tighten Montana that much more. With his lead among independents and the larger number of undecided Republicans willing to give him a shot, Montana is definitely going to be in play.
And favorability ratings:
McCain : 46 favorable, 35 unfavorable, 19 neutral Obama : 41 favorable, 38 unfavorable, 21 neutral Clinton : 29 favorable, 50 unfavorable, 21 neutral

It'll be nice heading into this general election without having to deal with Clinton's sky-high negatives. ::

WV and CT by kos Fri Jun 06, 2008 at 10:15:55 AM PDT
Connecticut
Rasmussen . 5/29. Likely voters. MoE 4.5% (3/11 results)
Obama (D) 47 (50) McCain (R) 44 (38)

Rasmussen notes that the previous poll was pre-Wright. My theory was that Obama's Democratic support had probably soften thanks to the primary. So it was time to dig into the internals:
5/29   Total   Men Wom  GOP Dem Other Obama   47     39  54   18  67  43 McCain  44     52  36   77  21  48
3/11   Total   Men Wom  GOP Dem Other Obama   50     47  53   17  73  50 McCain  38     43  34   79  13  37

Hmmm. Obama has weakened with independents, which could point to a Wright Effect. But he has also weakened a dramatic 14 points with Democrats, which is a clear Primary Effect. But unlike most other places, Obama hasn't bled female support. It looks like male Democrats have decided to step back and further evaluate the candidates (and even flirt with McCain). This state won't be competitive when everyone comes home.
Nor should West Virginia be competitive, but McCain is showing some surprising early weakness.
West Virginia
Rasmussen . 6/2. Likely voters. MoE 4% (No trend lines)
McCain (R) 45 Obama (D) 37

The crosstabs:
       Total   Men Wom  GOP Dem Other McCain  45     41  50   78  32  36 Obama   37     40  34   13  48  39 
Kerry only won Democrats in West Virginia by a 69-30 margin in 2004, so they are already not a bunch inclined to vote en masse for their presidential candidate. And it would take an epic McCain collapse for Obama to match those numbers, much less improve on them.
It appears that McCain's weakness with Republicans and independents is making this race artificially close. But when Republicans come home, and the Appalachian Democrats don't, this state will likely go Red. This is certainly one of those few states in which Hillary would've done better. (But of course, we already knew that .) ::

"Our primary season has finally come to an end... Because of you, I can say that I will be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States of America.
America, this is our moment!  This is our time!"
---Barack Obama, June 3, 2008 
This morning: Best. Hangover. Evuh.
Cheers and Jeers starts in There's Moreville... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!] :: 
Cheers and Jeers for Wednesday, June 4, 2008
Note:  I feel lost and lonely.  Are you sure we can't spend a couple more months doing primaries like, say, in Europe?

CHEERS to blessed silence.  It's over.  The voting booths are empty.  The delegates are pledged.  The airwaves are mercifully free of ads.  The yard signs, confetti and champagne bottles are being swept up.  And at long last we have our nominee.  Our grateful thanks to everyone who entered the race and helped America get re-acquainted with our superior Democrat-brand product: Biden, Edwards, Dodd, Kucinich, Clinton, Richardson and, yeah, even Gravel.  You'll each be receiving a consolation prize package worth over 200 dollars, including a gift certificate good for any of the fine products in the Spiegel Catalog and a supply of Necco Wafers.  Okay...what the hell do we do now?
JEERS to sore losers.  Yes, this is a time for healing.  But I'll be goddamned if I'm going to play footsies with anyone on our team who plans to sabotage our chances of winning in November just because they think politics is akin to a game of solitaire, where if you don’t like the results you can just pick up the cards and start over.  Our advice: sit down, take a deep breath, pull out a piece of paper, and list all the ways John McCain will continue to encourage America's swan dive into an empty pool.  Here, I'll get you started:
Attacking Roe v. Wade Iraq 4Evuh! Economic chaos Cronyism and incompetence Ignoring the poor Sucking up to the corporations Allowing our infrastructure to collapse Pissing off the rest of the world Treating the environment like an ugly stepsister 
You know them by heart after eight years of Bush/Cheney.  We all do.  Now draw a line through each item on your list.   That's what having a Democrat in the White House means.  So go beat on some pillows and scream your lungs out if you have to (shit, that's what I did when Kerry got the nomination).  Then come back into the fold and help end this uber-insanity.  And maybe, just maybe, find a little room in your heart to celebrate the first African-American to be a nominee for President of the United States.  The Democratic nominee.   OUR nominee...and a damn fine one.
Love and Kisses,

Syd Golston, a veteran teacher and social studies consultant for the Phoenix Union High School District, has seen a big change even from 2004.  ...  The climate is translating into huge interest, says Brian Brady, executive director of the Mikva Challenge, a Chicago non-profit that gets kids involved in the political process.  "It's sort of a myth that they're apathetic," he says.  "There's a lot that they care about."
He invited 101 students to campaign for the candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire and had "way too many" who wanted to go.   "This has been the best election ever for civics.  Even if you're somewhat impervious to politics, it's seeping into your consciousness."
Only downside: by listening to campaign surrogates, they've figured out how to weasel their way out of cleaning their rooms.
JEERS to the brass thinking with their butts (again).  Oh, this is so smart it could only come from the mind of a general.  Step one: Build a facility at the 180,000 acre-sized Fort Benning for troops recovering from PTSD.  Step 2: Make sure it's plopped right next to a firing range :
Health experts say that housing soldiers near a firing range subjects them to a continual trigger for PTSD.  "It would definitely traumatize them," said Harold McRae, a psychotherapist in Columbus, Ga., who counsels dozens of soldiers with PTSD who are at Fort Benning.  "It would be like you having a major car wreck on the interstate" and then living in a home overlooking the freeway, he said.  "Every time you hear a wreck or the brakes lock up, you are traumatized." 
I hope the media doesn’t get wind of the burn unit located next to the ACME Modeling Agency.  Are there any grown-ups in charge here???
CHEERS to surprising revelations.  I've read for years that recycling is both ineffective and a money-losing venture.  I was just about to give up on the idea when, SHAZAM!!! , I read this :
A surge in household recycling in the past year is saving some greater Portland communities tens of thousands of dollars, and is expected to generate a record $950,000 annual surplus from recycling for ecomaine, the region's waste disposal cooperative. ...
The success of recycling is so great that, combined with what may be the effects of a slowing economy, the agency is now looking for additional long-term sources of non-recyclable trash to maintain a steady fuel supply for its waste-to-energy plant in Portland. 
Officials say they're leaning toward a material that's plentiful, combustible, and no one wants to use a second time: Republican ideas.
JEERS to chores we hate no matter how easy they are.  Ninety seven years ago, the first washer/dryer combo went on sale.  It was followed the next day by the first husbands to totally ignore it.
CHEERS to BiPMostradamus.  I've been predicting for awhile now that pretty soon they'll be giving away free houses in Cracker Jack boxes.  In San Diego, they're almost there.  One real estate developer's offer: Buy One House, Get One Free .  But here's the fine print: the freebie's only worth $400,000.  Meh.  Fill it up with gas and we'll talk.

One Year Ago in C&J: June 4, 2007...
JEERS to Republican logic.  Colorado congressman and presidential candidate Tom Tancredo answers questions in this week's issue of TIME .  Gotta love this:
I have no doubt that global warming exists. I just question the cause and what we can do to ameliorate it.  But I wonder why the Sierra Club isn't going crazy about the environmental aspects of massive immigration into the U.S.   The fact is, Americans consume more energy than anyone else, so if a person moves here from another country, they automatically become bigger polluters.
Conversely, so the logic goes, if we send Americans to other countries, we'll automatically become smaller polluters.  Perhaps we should start with Republican congressmen.

And just one more...
CHEERS to My Preeecious .  Thirty one years ago, on June 4, 1977, the first personal computer---Apple II---went on sale.  I'm guessing that, in today's dollars, it would probably cost around $8,000.  Their original ads seem   quaint today .  Our favorite one stars meta-blogger Ben Franklin .  The copy is priceless:
Rather revolutionary, the whole idea of owning your own computer?  Not if you're a diplomat, printer, scientist...or a kite designer.  Today there's Apple Computer.  It's designed to be a personal computer.  To uncomplicated your life.  And make you more effective. ...
Apple is a real computer, right to the core.  So just like big computers, it manages data, crunches numbers, keeps records, processes your information And prints reports.  You concentrate on what you do best.  And let Apple do the rest.  Apple makes that easy with three programming languages---including Pascal---that let you be your own software expert.
Time waiting for access to your company's big mainframe is time wasted.  What you need in your department---on your desk---is a computer that answers only to you...Apple Computer.  It's less expensive than time sharing.  More dependable than distributed processing.  Far more flexible than centralized EDP.  And, at less than $2,500, downright affordable. 
Funny.  Windows Vista just gave me a pop-message that reads, "Oh, Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple!!!  Give it a rest already!"  Touchy.

TITLE: Senator, VA Secretary Disrespect Troops on Memorial Day


TEXT:

Senator, VA Secretary Disrespect Troops on Memorial Day by Brandon Friedman Mon May 26, 2008 at 06:22:36 PM PDT
(Promoted by MissLaura)
On Memorial Day weekend, Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) and VA Secretary James Peake stood side-by-side in Fairbanks, Alaska to showcase their opposition to--and lack of respect for--today’s newest veterans.
Speaking at the Disabled American Veterans’ 19th Annual Department Convention, Senator Stevens told the majority of America’s most recent war veterans that they had not yet sacrificed enough to have earned a GI Bill that would cover the full cost of their educations.  
Sen. Ted Stevens warned of a "mass exodus" from the military Saturday if the so-called 21st Century GI Bill goes into law without major changes. :: "There are worries that people who are already in for two years will serve one more and leave, and there’s really no incentive to stay," Stevens said. 
What Stevens is really saying is that today's troops are unpatriotic --that they're only in it for the money and the college.  And while Stevens’ "mass exodus" theory has been thoroughly discredited by the Congressional Budget Office, the true irony of the situation lies in the fact that Stevens earned his own college degree after World War Two by using the same GI Bill he’s aiming to prevent today’s veterans from receiving.  
At the same convention, VA Secretary James Peake--who is already under fire for the cover-up of an extraordinary number of veteran suicides and for overseeing an organization that may not be taking PTSD seriously --showed a stunning lack of situational awareness by discounting recent media reports and think tank studies by suggesting that fewer returning vets actually had PTSD than is commonly thought.
On the topic of PTSD, Peake questioned if the condition is being overdiagnosed, considering the mental health services available to those in the armed forces.
"I worry about labeling all these kids coming back," he said. "Just because someone might need a little counseling when they get back, doesn’t mean they need the PTSD label their whole lives." 
The only reason Peake worries about "labeling all these kids" is because he understands neither the cause of combat PTSD nor how it should be treated.  If Peake viewed PTSD as a combat injury sustained in theater--as the troops and the psychiatrists do--then he wouldn’t worry about the "stigma."  As it stands now, Peake is apparently content to perpetuate the myth of the "crazy, unstable vet guy."  In fact, what Peake--a former contractor--is saying directly contradicts the message of VA psychiatrists like Jonathan Shay:
The American Psychiatric Association has saddled us with the jargon "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder " (PTSD)--which sounds like an ailment--even though it is evident from the definition that what we are dealing with is an injury . . .We do not refer to a veteran who has had an arm blown off by a grenade as suffering from "Missing Army Disorder." [. . .]  Combat PTSD is a war injury.  Veterans with combat PTSD are war wounded, carrying the burdens of sacrifice for the rest of us as surely as the amputees, the burned, the blind, and the paralyzed carry them. 
To say the least, it’s alarming that the VA Secretary doesn’t get this.
Unfortunately, this double-barreled blast of disrespect for the service of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans on Memorial Day weekend from a Republican Senator and a Bush appointee is not unexpected.  We’re used to it.  However, it should provide all of us with an extra jolt of motivation to rid our nation of those who hold today’s troops in such contempt. :: :: Also available at VetVoice

The Can't Do Spirit by Devilstower Thu Jun 05, 2008 at 05:15:53 PM PDT
More of what you've come to expect from a Republican administration -- and more of what a McCain Extension would deliver in the next cycle.  When it comes to making changes, just say it's too hard .   
The United States will tell a July meeting of the Group of Eight rich nations that it cannot meet big cuts in emissions of planet-warming gases by 2020, its chief climate negotiator Harlan Watson said.
"It's frankly not do-able for us," he told Reuters on Tuesday, referring to a goal for rich countries to curb greenhouse gases by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. 
Note that this is the "Gang of Eight," not the UN.  We're not racing the whole world to do better in this case, only the other rich, developed nations that are supposed to be our peers in this endeavor.  And the Europeans have already said they can beat the target that's been set.  
There's no question that the Republicans will remain the immovable blockheads for the rest of the Bush administration.  The only question will be how quickly an Obama administration can reintroduce a concept that now seems foreign to America.  Yes we can. ::

TITLE: House and Senate Roundup, 5/29


TEXT:

House and Senate Roundup, 5/29 by brownsox Thu May 29, 2008 at 02:05:26 PM PDT
OK-Sen: During the 2008 legislative session in the Oklahoma Senate, Andrew Rice has directed much of his attention to passing "Steffanie's Law", a healthcare reform bill named for the late Steffanie Collings. Some background :
In the 2008 legislative session, Sen. Rice introduced "Steffanie's Law," which would require insurance companies to cover routine medical costs for patients enrolled in clinical trials.  The bill is named after Steffanie Collings, a young woman from Noble who lost her battle to brain cancer this March.  After Steffanie enrolled in a clinical trial - which offered her only chance to survive - her family accumulated $400,000 in debt when the Collings' insurance company refused to continue covering basic medical care unrelated to the clinical trial. 
The DSCC created a video featuring Steffanie Collings' father, Monty, in which he talks of his family's ordeal and his relationship with Rice:

Unfortunately, although Steffanie's Law passed the Oklahoma Senate with broad support, Republican leadership in the Oklahoma House killed the bill in committee, refusing to let it reach the floor for a vote.
From the Rice campaign :
At the end of the legislative session, Sen. Rice vowed to continue to fight for this issue when elected to the U.S. Senate.  "This bill passed the Senate with a bi-partisan majority twice but never received a hearing or vote in the House," Sen. Rice said in a statement released at the end of session. "We did everything we could this session, but if the elected leadership of the Oklahoma House of Representatives refuses to hear the people's voices, we will have to take the people's voices all the way to Washington D.C." 
MS-Sen : Rasmussen's latest bundle of joy shows former Democratic Governor Ronnie Musgrove leading incumbent Republican Senator Roger Wicker by one point, 47% to 46%.
Musgrove leads by ten points among women but trails by eight among men. The Democratic challenger leads among voters under 50 while the GOP incumbent leads among those who have passed the half-century mark. Musgove is supported by 81% of Democrats, Wicker by 76% of Republicans, and Wicker holds a very modest 44% to 40% lead among the state’s unaffiliated voters.
Both men are viewed favorably by 49% of the state’s voters. Wicker is viewed unfavorably by 32% and Musgrove by 42%.
Twenty-two percent (22%) have a Very Unfavorable opinion of Musgrove. Just 10% hold such a negative view of Wicker. 
This is the third recent poll to show a toss-up race in Mississippi...and a golden pickup opportunity for Democrats in a deeply red state.
In Mississippi's other Senate race, 30-year incumbent Thad Cochran is coasting to victory, leading State Sen. Erik Fleming 58-35. Fleming ran against Trent Lott in 2006 and suffered an overwhelming defeat.
And in the presidential race, Obama trails McCain by only six points. If he wins, I think he owes DavidNYC a Coke.
AL-Sen : Finally, Rasmussen has some good news for Republicans. Their polling shows Democrat Vivian Davis Figures (who was not considered an exceptionally strong candidate to begin with) trailing incumbent Jeff Sessions, 62% to 29%.
This is comparable to Obama's level in the state; he trails McCain 60% to 32%. Clinton does a little better, but not much; she trails 54% to 34%.
In Rasmussen's last poll, in April, Figures trailed by a smaller margin, 57-36. Obama trailed 55-37 in that poll, and Clinton trailed 51-40.
May has apparently not been kind to Dems in Alabama.
NC-Sen : Evidently nervous about her incredible shrinking polling lead over Democrat Kay Hagan, Republican Elizabeth Dole has decided it's time to go for broke.
No, I mean actually go for broke. She is spending almost one-sixth of her hard-earned campaign cash on this "illegal immigration" ad:

Illegal immigration, it seems, is very bad, according to this ad. Unfortunately, as Senate Guru notes, Dole has already been stung by North Carolina media for her failures on this issue:
Sen. Dole worked hard to help kill a decent immigration reform bill in the U.S. Senate in July. It wasn't perfect, but it provided a practical, intelligent way to secure the border -- and pay for it. It also took the sensible step of providing illegal immigrants a conditional path to legal status. Too bad lawmakers such as Sen. Dole were more interested in shouting "amnesty" and opposing any step toward legal status than they were in helping the folks back home. 
House Races OH-15 : Via the Politico, some positively delicious polling news:
Franklin County Commissioner Mary Jo Kilroy (D) holds a 10-point lead over Republican state senator Steve Stivers in the race to succeed retiring Rep. Deborah Pryce (R-Ohio), according to her campaign’s internal polling.
The poll shows Kilroy leading Stivers, 47 to 37 percent. Kilroy is benefiting from fairly high name identification (78 percent), largely from her closely-contested campaign against Pryce last election cycle. She had a net favorability rating of 10 percent -- 44 percent of respondents held a favorably opinion of her, while 34 percent viewed her unfavorably.
Kilroy’s favorability rating has rebounded from her political standing in October 2006, when a plurality of voters held an unfavorable opinion of her. 
Kilroy lost her 2006 race by just one point to incumbent Deborah Pryce. Although Stivers was the GOP's first choice for this open-seat race a ten-point deficit is going to be difficult for him to vercome, especially as Kilroy's favorables are improving.
AZ-01 : The DCCC has selected their latest Red to Blue candidate, Arizona State Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick .
Chairman Chris Van Hollen announced today that Ann Kirkpatrick (AZ-01) will immediately be added to the DCCC's Red to Blue program for open seats following her endorsement by Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano. Congressional candidates earn a spot in the competitive program by surpassing demanding fundraising goals and by skillfully showing voters that they stand for change and will represent new priorities when elected to Congress.  Kirkpatrick is one of only 11 candidates in the Red to Blue program for open seats.
"Born and raised in Arizona, Ann Kirkpatrick understands the challenges facing Arizona families. Ann's experience in city, county and state government and her commitment to promoting economic development, while protecting Arizona's environment, will make her an effective voice for clean government and change," said Chairman Chris Van Hollen. "The Red to Blue Program will give Ann the financial and structural edge to be even more competitive."   
AL-02 : While Rasmussen's statewide numbers in Alabama are pretty ugly for Democrats, Left in Alabama alerts us to Bob Martin's article in the Moulton Observer, in which he drops this tantalizing tidbit about Bobby Bright in AL-02 (emphasis mine):
On paper there is absolutely no reason Alabama’s 2nd Congressional District should be in play. President George Bush won this southeast Alabama district by 34 percentage points in 2004.  Yet this week, on the eve of the primary election, polls I have seen show Montgomery Mayor Bobby Bright, a Democrat, leading, not only all his Democratic opponents, but also all the Republican candidates in head-to-head match-ups . 
If Bright really is leading all his Republican challengers at this juncture, in an R+13.2 district, the Republican party is several miles farther up the creek than even I had ever dared imagine.
NE-02 : Despite sitting in theoretically safe Nebraska, in a generally red district, Republican Lee Terry is apparently freaking out about Barack Obama and the possibility he might win this Omaha-based district. Via MSNBC (hat tip to New Nebraska Network ):
And the man who represents the Second Congressional District, Republican Rep. Lee Terry, said he thinks Obama will be making a play for his district.
"Obama has an office in Omaha, so I assume he is competing for it," said Terry.
He added, "It’s going to be pretty hard work (for Obama to win the district). I know of a recent poll that had McCain up by seven points in the Second Congressional District. But you never know what can happen in this district this year." 
So the only recourse for Terry, it seems...is to align himself with Obama !
Esch is hoping an Obama surge here will help him but Terry's ready to fight, with help from an all new team, what Terry calls "The Obama-Terry voter." Terry says they are, "people who want the right kind of change."
Esch told me today he'd like to meet the Obama-Terry voters. According to Esch he, "can't imagine what they look like." 
They probably look a bit like unicorns, methinks.
Don't get too excited, though, for as James L. at SSP puckishly points out , Lee Terry is not a Democratic superdelegate.
NY-13 : Each day, it seems, brings more news in the major parties' scramble to find candidates to fill disgraced Rep. Vito Fossella's seat.
Democrat Michael Cusick, one of a triumvirate of top-shelf Democratic candidates in the district, has opted out (as did State Sen. Diane Savino previously).
This will leave City Councilman Michael McMahon as the highest-profile Dem considering the race. McMahon has received the nomination of the Richmond County Democratic Party:
The Staten Island Democratic Party voted on Wednesday night to endorse City Councilman Michael E. McMahon as its choice for the Congressional seat being vacated by Representative Vito J. Fossella, a Republican.
Mr. McMahon, who has represented the North Shore of Staten Island for the last seven years, said he had already received the support of the Brooklyn Democratic Party leader, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, as well as other Democratic elected officials who had considered running for the seat. The district includes all of Staten Island and portions of Brooklyn.
"I am humbled by this responsibility, and I’m very optimistic about the new beginning in this district," Mr. McMahon said in an interview on Wednesday night.
"I think we can turn the seat back into the hands of the Democrats for the first time in 28 years," he said. "I’ve been fighting for the people of my Council district, and I will continue to stand up for the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn to deal with local issues such as transportation and health care."  ::

Cheers and Jeers: Wednesday by Bill in Portland Maine Wed May 28, 2008 at 04:55:53 AM PDT
From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...
MASSIVE JEERS to Scott McClellan. The latest former Bush lapdog---he was press secretary from '03 to '06---to come out of the woodwork has several juicy nuggets in his hot-off-the-presses tell-all book. Bottom line: he confirms everything that we dirty hippie bloggers were screaming about at the top of our lungs, but which the traditional media ignored because...well, because Scott McClellan stood at his little White House podium and denied it all, lying out of his fat little elitist face as the stenographers printed his crap without scrutiny.
Once again, we come face to face with a White House official who could've done the right thing...but instead decided that the lives of American troops, Iraqi civilians, Katrina victims, and a network of covert CIA operatives were worth less than the luster of his master's lapel pin. When our country needed him to tell it straight, he hid behind propaganda and spin and bogus talking points and outright bamboozlement.
He told us to our faces we could trust him, when all along he knew that he was committing deception on a massive scale with horrific consequences. The lies he left in his wake, placed end to end, could reach the moon and back. He helped put the welfare of a handful of maniacal warmongers ahead of the welfare of the country. The time to reveal the way the Bushies were "restoring honor and integrity to the White House" was back then ---years ago---when such revelations might've done some good. Instead, he waited until 2008 for his conscience dump. What bravery. What a mighty mighty man.
If there was any justice in the world, Scott McClellan would have to travel to the home of every family member who lost a loved one in Iraq, get down on his knees, and beg forgiveness. But he won't. Instead, we get 341 pages of, Hey, I was just following orders .
The only thing that Scott McClellan should collect from his book is dust.
There. I feel better now. Cheers and Jeers starts in There's Moreville... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!] :: 
Cheers and Jeers for Wednesday, May 28, 2008

CHEERS to hangin' with Howard.   Time magazine readers ask the DNC chair about this and that...
Do you see any situation whereby the delegates from Michigan and Florida are not seated? Howard Dean: There'll be three principles that the Rules Committee looks at: 1) fairness to the voters; 2) fairness to the campaigns, who started off under a set of rules believing that Michigan and Florida would not be seated; 3) fairness to the 48 states who did the right thing and stayed with the process. I do believe that Michigan and Florida will be seated in some way.
Do you favor the elimination of the Electoral College? Yes. It's unrepresentative of where the American people are. It was fine for the days of the Pony Express, but it's not necessary to avoid a popular vote on Presidents now.
People disapprove of the job Congress is doing. Does that mean the gains made in the 2006 election will be lost in 2008? No. The public clearly agrees with Democrats on the major issues of the economy, the war and health care, and I think they feel very frustrated that the Republicans are preventing any of the reforms that the public wanted in 2006 from going into effect.
Would you like to say this morning's magic words to America? Sure. Happy Humpday, you humpety hump humpers!! 
Okay, maybe I made the last one up. Maybe.
CHEERS to the Maine event.  The Republicans had their state convention a couple weeks ago---it was a small, dour affair and the crackers were stale.  This weekend the Democrats hold their own convention, and it promises to be a little bit... different :
The under-21 crowd numbers 288---far more than usual---among the 3,400 [delegates] elected during February's caucuses to attend the Friday-Sunday convention at the Augusta Civic Center, Manning said. ... Organizers expect such a large turnout of delegates in general that they've had to arrange to use a half-dozen sites away from the civic center to hold convention-related meetings.
Sam Shapiro, a former state treasurer who has attended every state convention for the last half century, plans to go to this one as well. Shapiro recalls waves of excitement for candidates outside of the party's mainstream that spiked participation in past conventions, but added, "it's never been anything like this."
We hear keynoter Dick Durbin plans to give his speech and then go totally mosh pit.  Goddam if it ain't great being a Democrat these days.
JEERS to hardening of the attitudes.  What irony: with age is supposed to come wisdom, but too often the opposite is true.   Exhibit A :
By bare majorities, Californians reject the state Supreme Court's decision to allow same-sex marriages and back a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at the November ballot that would outlaw such unions, a Los Angeles Times/KTLA Poll has found. ...  Those under 45 were less likely to favor a constitutional amendment than their elders and were more supportive of the court's decision to overturn the state's current ban on gay marriage. They also disagreed more strongly than their elders with the notion that gay relationships threatened traditional marriage. 
The silver lining, as Slate's Emily Bazelon points out , is that support for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts swung 21 points in less than ten months once people got even a teeny bit used to it.  So the strategy for victory in California is clear: tie the knot ASAP, Adam and Steve and Adele and Eve, and then get out there in your plaid shorts and...um...be boring.
JEERS to the great automotive takesie-backsie.  I remember when George W. Bush got installed by the Supreme Court in 2000.  Almost overnight it seemed like Americans flooded car dealerships to buy SUVs, trucks and other assorted gas-guzzlers.  It smacked of irrational exuberance.  (The apex of this madness was when the Republican congress approved a huge tax break for companies that bought Hummers.)  Did people think we'd stumbled on some bottomless oil well?  Were they that short-sighted???  Answer: Yes.  And the death of the SUV is utterly predictable .  Oh well...they'll make lovely paperweights.
CHEERS to the greening of the DNC.  This year's convention in Denver is going to be big on eco-friendly practices, including the vittles .  But have they gone too far?
Fried foods are forbidden at the committee's 22 or so events, as is liquid served in individual plastic containers. Plates must be reusable, like china, recyclable or compostable. The food should be local, organic or both.  And caterers must provide foods in "at least three of the following five colors: red, green, yellow, blue/purple, and white," garnishes not included, according to a Request for Proposals, or RFP, distributed last week. ...
Caterers praise the committee and the city for their green ambitions, but some say they're baffled by parts of the RFP.  "I think it's a great idea for our community and our environment. The question is, how practical is it?" asks Nick Agro, the owner of Whirled Peas Catering in Commerce City. ... "I'll cook anything, but I've had clients who have approached me about all-organic menus, and then they see the organic stuff pretty much doubles your price." 
Wait a minute: no fried foods?  Tsk tsk.  It just won’t be the same not being able to make elephant ears disappear. 
CHEERS to splishin' and splashin'.  Two hundred and sixty six years ago today, England's first indoor swimming pool opened.  It was followed the next day by the first pool-side sign: "We don't swim in thy toilet.  Please don't pee in mine pool."
CHEERS to the silence of the pundits.  I know I shouldn’t be cocky, but I'm laughing my ass off.  Remember all the dire warnings from the talking heads who screamed that the lengthy Democratic primary season would give John McCain a whopping head start?  Remember how we're supposed to be eating his dust by now?  Well, those warnings---big surprise---were apparently unfounded, since the maverick still seems to be asleep in his stall .  Of course, given that it's McCain, maybe this is what fourth gear looks like for him...in which case I'd almost feel guilty not giving him a head start.  Almost.
CHEERS to the human version of Mapquest.  An 11 year-old Nebraska kid with the traditional Nebraskan name Akshay Rajagopal was given a $25,000 check after winning the National Geographic Bee.  He won by knowing that Cochabamba is the third-largest conurbation in Bolivia.  Apparently he can find anything anywhere withut a map. His mom would be more impressed if his underwear could find the bottom of the hamper.  Soulmates, kid---you and me.
-
Two Years Ago in C&J: May 28, 2006...
JEERS to reefer madness.  More evidence that we've outlawed the wrong smoking sticks:  A big fat doobie of a study says marijuana---even among heavy users---does NOT cause lung cancer :  "What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect."  Two-pack-a-day cigarette smokers, meanwhile, showed a 20-fold increase in lung cancer.  Our new slogan for our campaign against the anti-pot propaganda crowd: "Just Say Bullshit!"
-
And just one more...
CHEERS to "a speeding bullet photographed by a speeding bullet" (via Boing Boing).  Check out this unbelievable shot, taken by the Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRise camera, of the Phoenix lander as it drops in on Mars .  If NASA isn’t careful, they're gonna undo all of George Bush's hard work and make science cool again.
-
Oh, and happy 64th birthday, Rudy---you still look fabulous .  Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?

TITLE: The Michigan Line-up, Part II


TEXT:

The Michigan Line-up, Part II by DHinMI Sat May 31, 2008 at 10:35:25 AM PDT
Mark Brewer is the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.  Mark's an attorney who's mostly done labor law and election law, with a lot of pro bono work on civil rights issues.  But his path to the chair of the MDP was from his chairmanship of the old Ninth Congressional District of Michigan.  The Ninth had a political machine on behalf of the Democratic incumbent that was possibly the most impressive grassroots and professional operation on a CD level in America.  It was to a Congressional campaign what Paul Wellstone's amazing operation was on a statewide level.    
That grassroots machine centered in Michigan's Macomb county, the operation chaired by Mark Brewer, was the machine of former Congressman David Bonior.  
In Michigan in the late 80's and early 90's, one of the divides in the Michigan Democratic party was between the more moderate wing represented by Jim Blanchard, and liberal/labor wing represented by David Bonior, the UAW and the AFL-CIO.  As Blanchard became more haughty and his popularity waned in 1989 and 1990, the party atrophied.  Blanchard lost his gubernatorial reelection to John Engler in a huge upset in the 1990 election, checked out of Michigan politics for a few years, but resurfaced in 1992 to support Bill Clinton.  
When Clinton was elected, he named Blanchard ambassador to Canada, where Blanchard championed the passage of NAFTA.  Bonior became the whip in Congress, and led the charge against the passage of NAFTA.  And after the devastating losses in 1994, Mark Brewer became chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.  
Blanchard eventually left the Ambassadorship, wrote a book, and spent most of the late 90's working with a DC law firm.  Bonior fought the fight in DC, and fought the fight in Michigan.  In 2002 Bonior decided to run for Governor.  It surprised many, because Bonior was right behind Dick Gephardt in the Democratic power structure in Congress.  But what really surprised people was that Jim Blanchard decided to drop back in to Michigan and run for governor (with his campaign polling provided by Mark Penn).  
Both lost in the primary to Jennifer Granholm, and the morning after the primary election both showed their character.  At that Wednesday morning unity breakfast, Bonior showed up early, and made his entire campaign staff show up and stay through the entire event.  It had to have killed them.  A few of the staffers later told me that it was a miserable, horrible morning.  But Bonior knew it was the right thing to do, to bring the party together, and to show support for Granholm, and so did his staff.  
Blanchard, on the other hand, showed up for about 20 minutes, and left the room before the breakfast even started.  I think he may not even have waited long enough to congratulate Granholm in person.  It was one of the most crass, bush league performances I've ever seen in politics.  
Bonior has spent the last few years since he left Congress as a strong advocate for organized labor.  He's helped candidates, and he's taught at Detroit's fine urban institution, Wayne State University.  He's been involved in foreign issues, and worked to help progressive causes.  He then moved down to North Carolina and managed John Edwards' populist campaign for President.  Blanchard, on the other hand, went back to his DC law firm, until it was time to jump in and be Michigan co-chair of the Clinton campaign.  
The next two people to offer testimony at the conclusion of this round of questions will be David Bonior on behalf of the Obama campaign, and Jim Blanchard on behalf of the Clinton campaign.   ::

Livestreaming here (CNN), here (MSNBC), or here (CSPAN).
Update:  According to MSNBC, when Hillary announces that she is suspending versus ending her campaign, it's for legal reasons related to campaign debt. ::

TITLE: RNC Chastises Obama For Not Visiting Iraq. Well, They've Got Guts...


TEXT:

RNC Chastises Obama For Not Visiting Iraq. Well, They've Got Guts... by Hunter Fri May 30, 2008 at 06:45:28 AM PDT
From an RNC press release, we learn that the RNC has apparently started counting how long it's been since Obama has been to Iraq. He was there in 2006, you see, but that's been it, and as the RNC says...
[Obama] displays an arrogant certainty gained on the campaign trail. How would Obama make informed judgments in the future when he has not seen the situation in Iraq since the surge began? 
Oh, mercy. Well, I suppose I admire the RNC's willingness to plunge headlong into support for McCain's Iraq trips. I remember well that fateful trip of McCain's , one that apparently left him with no appreciable understanding of who it was we were fighting, or why they were fighting each other, or even that strolling down a mostly-bare marketplace surrounded by a hundred U.S. soldiers and air support is not what any rational human would call "walking freely" through Bagdad. [Sgt. Matthew Roe / AP]
The merchants at the market McCain toured thought his characterizations of what he had seen bordered on the delusional :
A day after members of an American Congressional delegation led by Senator John McCain pointed to their brief visit to Baghdad’s central market as evidence that the new security plan for the city was working, the merchants there were incredulous about the Americans’ conclusions. [...]
At a news conference shortly after their outing, Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, and his three Congressional colleagues described Shorja as a safe, bustling place full of hopeful and warmly welcoming Iraqis — "like a normal outdoor market in Indiana in the summertime," offered Representative Mike Pence, an Indiana Republican who was a member of the delegation. [...]
At least 61 people were killed and many more wounded in a three-pronged attack there on Feb. 12 involving two vehicle bombs and a roadside bomb. [...]
In recent weeks, snipers hidden in Shorja’s bazaar have killed several people, merchants and the police say, and gunfights have erupted between militants and the Iraqi security forces in the area. 
The move backfired badly here at home and even among military personnel , making McCain into something of a laughingstock for his rosy assessments:
[CNN Reporter Michael Ware:] To suggest that there’s any neighborhood in this city where an American can walk freely is beyond ludicrous. I’d love Sen. McCain to tell me where that neighborhood is and he and I can go for a stroll.
And to think that Gen. David Petraeus travels this city in an unarmed humvee? I mean, in the hour since Sen. McCain’s said this, I’ve spoken to military sources and there was laughter down the line. 
And McCain couldn't go back to that market this year, on his most recent "factfinding" trip, because it's now in territory controlled by al Sadr .
S o apparently visiting Iraq isn't all that it's cracked up to be, given that every time McCain does it he manages to leave with an impression of the war that is more and more at odds with the reality of whatever it is he's just seen. He's very Bushlike, in that regard -- when he shows up, you'd better damn well show him the Potemkin villages, because that's the part he wants to see.
I've got to hand it to the RNC for continuing the Bush tradition of believing photo ops to be magical things, capable of altering the fabric of reality into whatever it is conservatives need it to be at any given point in time. And perhaps Obama will indeed visit Iraq again before the election. If he does, let's hope he doesn't make as much of a laughingstock of himself as McCain managed to. ::

TITLE: If Clinton Really Wanted to Be VP...


TEXT:

If Clinton Really Wanted to Be VP... by MissLaura Wed Jun 04, 2008 at 08:00:47 AM PDT
If Hillary Clinton really wanted to be Barack Obama's vice presidential pick, what course would make sense for her?
To speak privately to Obama, and to make her case.  In public to congratulate him on his great victory, and to take back some of her most damaging attacks on him.  To say nothing about the vice-presidency except that the choice is, and has always been, up to the winning candidate, and should be, and he should have some weeks to enjoy his victory and move fully into general election mode before he publicly addresses this issue, and that she too needs such time.
Imagine on the contrary that Clinton wanted simultaneously to undercut Obama and to advance her own interests.  What then would be her best move?
Exactly what she did.
We all know Obama is the prohibitive favorite for November, but Clinton still does not believe it, and it's in precisely that (lack of) belief that she's making sure everyone knows she was willing to bail him out all along -- so whatever happens is his fault for not taking her up on her generous offer.
But of course, in truth her contributions to the Obama campaign will be judged not on her last-ditch, end-of-candidacy efforts to seize the spotlight, but on her work every day from now until November to unify the Democratic party and defeat McCain. ::

TITLE: John McCain, One-Man Nuclear Security Risk


TEXT:

John McCain, One-Man Nuclear Security Risk by Plutonium Page Sun May 25, 2008 at 04:13:04 PM PDT
... if I take a spell I want to blow my lid, I can [unintelligible] a bunch of sorry-ass government motherf**kers down the drain. I want something that can do a bunch at a time with minimum of ease...
You get me one of those [ improvised nuclear devices ] and help me get it back to my country... anything to get my hands on one ... 
That's from the transcript of a conversation between an undercover FBI agent and white supremacist Demetrius "Van" Crocker.  From the October 26, 2004 Global Security Newswire :
Federal authorities said Demetrius "Van" Crocker, 39, was arrested yesterday after meeting with an undercover federal agent in an attempt to purchase sarin nerve agent and conventional explosives.
[snip]
Yesterday’s operation followed a seven-month investigation that began when the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation was told that Crocker was attempting to acquire "nuclear waste and/or nuclear materials," according to the affidavit. 
The story got almost no press coverage outside of Tennessee even though Crocker's goals weren't all that different from al Qaeda, which "...continues to pursue its strategic objective of obtaining a nuclear weapon [and nuclear materials]." (9/11 commission statement, pdf ).
Of course, as soon we hear "al Qaeda", most of us think "that terrorist network 'over there', nothing to worry about here at home.  That loose nuke stuff is 'over there'.  No risks here."
Wrong.
From an article ( pdf ) in the November/December 2006 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists :
...[A] team of terrorists infiltrated Los Alamos National Laboratory’s sensitive Technical Area-18 (TA-18), shot their way past guards, and entered Kiva-3, one of three on-site assembly buildings where nuclear fission experiments are conducted. Once inside, the terrorists found what they had come for: two large plates of highly enriched uranium (HEU).
They unbolted the heavy plates, placed one on the floor, and held the other 6 feet above it. Months of planning came to fruition as they dropped the plate, initiating a chain reaction. In the blink of an eye, a nuclear "flash" nearly the size of the Hiroshima blast lit up the black desert sky for miles around.
[...]
[The DoE report] detailed the results of a force-on-force security test at Los Alamos in New Mexico, in which faux attackers used conventional means to devastate TA-18’s underprepared security force. 
Fortunately, the DoE acted appropriately, and moved the HEU and weapons-grade plutonium out of TA-18 (hopefully to a more secure location).
But that's not all.
The Project on Government Oversight ( POGO ) has been keeping track of security problems at multiple US government facilities that supposedly safeguard weapons-grade nuclear materials and components.  The examples are far too numerous to list; they range from the stunning ease at which potential terrorists could access weapons-grade HEU at the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to massive security holes at Lawrence Livermore Labs, only 48 miles from San Francisco, where literally thousands of pounds of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium are stored:
Now, TIME Magazine is reporting that in late April 2008, government mock terrorists tested Livermore Lab's security, and were able to defeat the protective force and gain access to their target-simulated [weapons-grade nuclear material]. After speaking with our sources on the ground at Livermore Lab, as well as at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), POGO has heard some of what happened. We are not that surprised by what we learned.
One reason the Lab's protective guard force was not able to defend the bomb-making material is because the hydraulic lift on the vehicles used to deploy the Lab's Dillon Aero M134D guns, popularly known as the Gatling gun, did not work.
[...] Another reason that the Lab's security was penetrated is that members of the Lab's SWAT team, known as a Special Response Team (SRT), have not trained together as a "team" for years. This goes against law enforcement best practices--guards need opportunities to see how their teammates actually communicate and respond during an emergency. 
  
Fortunately, the DoE has taken almost all of the audits seriously, although it's obviously a case of closing the barn door after a more organized version of a Demetrius Crocker and his white supremacist friends have grabbed their target material and escaped with it.
Obviously, nuclear terrorism is a very real national security concern, and it should be high on the next president's list of possible domestic threats, and our safety depends on who wins.
If John McCain is in the Oval Office, he is just as likely to drop the ball as Bush is when it comes to potential terrorist attacks. :: 
In 2005, Sen. Lugar (R-IN) introduced legislation to "address urgent [conventional and WMD] nonproliferation crises" beyond Russia, and therefore expand upon the original Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program.  McCain co-sponsored the legislation.  Before you think that's a feather in his hat when it comes to nuclear materials security, think again.  Examples: He did not bother to vote on  S. 4, The Improving America's Security Act of 2007 , which implements recommendations of the 9/11 commission, and specifically: 
... would require that the Director of National Intelligence and heads of relevant Departments annually review the global nuclear detection architecture and verify that it addresses current threat assessments. 

His idea of "keeping nuclear material out of the hands of terrorists" is hopelessly mixed up with his hawkish rhetoric on stopping Iran's nuclear program.  
See his essay in Foreign Affairs .  His solution to securing nuclear material is " leave it to the IAEA , it's nothing I want to deal with".
He has voted against increasing port security, including better tracking of nuclear materials ( more here ).
In stark contrast, Barack Obama has actually introduced multiple pieces of legislation to secure nuclear materials and has made the issue a cornerstone of his campaign .Click this link to read about Obama and Hagel's bill, S. 1977, which: 
...[provides] for sustained United States leadership in a cooperative global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce global nuclear arsenals, stop the spread of nuclear weapons and related material and technology, and support the responsible and peaceful use of nuclear technology. 
Among many other details, the bill creates a committee:
... to provide recommendations on the threat of the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons technology and nuclear terrorism, and to report on efforts to reduce global nuclear arsenals, the development of new nuclear weapons, the need for nuclear energy, and the contribution of existing multilateral entities 
Again, click the link .  It's truly good stuff.
The Senate passed the Obama-Hagel provision in September 2007
Finally: 
Obama, Schiff Provision to Create Nuclear Threat Reduction Plan Approved
This provision requires the President to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan for ensuring that all nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material at vulnerable sites around the world are secure by 2012 from the threats that terrorists have shown they can pose. 

For only three years in the Senate, Obama has accomplished a hell of a lot with regards to securing nuclear materials.  In other words, his campaign promises are backed up by actual efforts, focusing on real threats.  McCain offers only rhetoric and threats.
I know who I want in the White House.

No one could have predic... oh, wait! by Kagro X Mon May 26, 2008 at 06:50:13 AM PDT
I'm actually getting more than a little sick and tired of being right about this, not that it's at all difficult to predict. I guess what I'm really sick and tired of is people pretending it's a surprise when it happens:
Rove: Courts will have to decide his subpoena
By Hope Yen, Associated Press Writer  |  May 25, 2008
WASHINGTON --President Bush's former chief political adviser denied meddling in the Justice Department's prosecution of Alabama's ex-governor and said Sunday the courts will have to resolve a congressional subpoena for his testimony.
"Congress, the House Judiciary Committee, wants to be able to call presidential aides on its whim up to testify," Karl Rove said. "It's going to be tied up in court and settled in court." 
What a shocker. The House Judiciary Committee subpoenas Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten, and they don't show. Then they vote to hold the two of them in contempt of Congress, and the U.S. Attorney -- whose job it is to prosecute statutory contempt of Congress referrals -- refuses to prosecute. So the Congress is reduced to having to beg the federal courts to enforce their subpoenas. Starting with begging this from a former Whitewater prosecutor with, well, a rather startling record of sustaining Bush "administration" positions.
Yes, the same subpoenas that were touted as the most important reason for winning back the majority in Congress.
Gosh, I wish someone would have pointed out what the limitations of the subpoena power actually were, so that we could have seen the danger of overpromising on it.
Sigh.
Anyway, there's one more observation worth making here. I know the AP is just covering this for the sake of covering it, and we've all long since given up on beat reporters adding any analysis to the event coverage they're assigned, but this part jumped out at me as relatively wanting of background:
Rove also said his lawyers had offered alternative ways to provide the House committee information short of sworn testimony, but that lawmakers had refused. For example, Rove's lawyer, Robert Luskin, has said Rove could discuss the case on the condition that his comments not be under oath and not be transcribed.
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and several other lawmakers, however, have said such an interview "will not permit us to obtain a straightforward and clear record." 
And so the value of the "subpoena power" is finally reduced by the vestigial media to just another "he said, she said" story.
An AP reporter is told that Rove insists that testifying on the record and under oath before a Congressional investigative committee is, well, you know, just really pretty much the same thing as, well, you know, just really pretty much its exact opposite.
And she has to go to the Judiciary committee for a reaction on that.
Hoo boy.
Worse, what's the reaction she gets? Well, that kind of testimony -- if it really can be considered testimony at all -- "will not permit us to obtain a straightforward and clear record."
Uh, yeah. We get that. I mean, the statement is true and correct, but it lacks a certain something.
Like maybe, "Duh. What Rove suggests is not testifying before Congress. It is its exact opposite. You don't need us to 'clarify' this for you, Hope. It's in the f*$#ing dictionary." ::

How is this for some seriously messed up priorities?  During the run-up to the Iraq war, the White House was more than happy to have Judy Miller peddle the administration’s distortions and lies on the pages of the New York Times as a part of their campaign to sell a bogus war to an unsuspecting public. But an editorial that is critical of the White House for its opposition to Jim Webb’s G.I. Bill of Rights?   Them’s fightin’ words. :
Once again, the New York Times Editorial Board doesn't let the facts get in the way of expressing its vitriolic opinions - no matter how misleading they may be. 
Leaving aside the inappropriateness of the White House publicly whining about benefits for veterans on Memorial Day, let's look at some of the facts that the New York Times ignores in their effort to mislead the public:
. 
And here’s what they got right:
 President Bush opposes a new G.I. Bill of Rights... Having saddled the military with a botched, unwinnable war, having squandered soldiers’ lives and failed them in so many ways, the commander in chief now resists giving the troops a chance at better futures out of uniform. He does this on the ground that the bill is too generous and may discourage re-enlistment, further weakening the military he has done so much to break.
So lavish with other people’s sacrifices, so reckless in pouring the national treasure into the sandy pit of Iraq, Mr. Bush remains as cheap as ever when it comes to helping people at home.   [...]
Mr. Bush — and, to his great discredit, Senator John McCain — have argued against a better G.I. Bill, for the worst reasons.   [...]
By threatening to veto it, Mr. Bush is showing great consistency of misjudgment. Congress should forcefully show how wrong he is by overriding his opposition and spending the money — an estimated $52 billion over 10 years, a tiniest fraction of the ongoing cost of Mr. Bush’s Iraq misadventure. 
George Bush opposes the bill for obvious reasons...after all, supporting the troops has always been just a slogan for him.  And John McCain's opposition?  He thinks that requiring 12 years of service to get a whole $2000 a month for college is more than "generous," not to mention his fear that he won't have enough warm bodies for his 100 years in Iraq.  Of course what absolutely terrifies McCain about this overwhelminingly popular and bipartisan bill is that he'll have to vote against it.     ::

Cheers and Jeers: Monday by Bill in Portland Maine Mon Jun 02, 2008 at 04:38:44 AM PDT
UNIFY!
It's sad watching all the yelling and screaming and eyeball-scratching going on lately. It needs to stop. I'm personally sick of it.
We cannot afford a third term of George W. Bush. Nobody except his mother would disagree with that. It would be an unmitigated disaster. Iraq will remain a quagmire. The economy will drift even further into chaos. The rest of the world will continue to hate us.
And yet some of you sit there and say that you'll vote for John McCain just because you have a burr up your butt. Unbelievable. I understand that your passions run deep and you've worked your heart out, but this has now spun off into the absurd.
I ask you---I implore you---over the next few months, search your conscience. Think about what a McCain administration will bring. And then think about the alternative, which offers hope and common sense and the first chance to bring a mustache to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue since William Howard Taft.
Yes, I'm talking to you, Republicans: you must control your knee-jerk reflexes, take a deep breath, step back from the precipice, and vote for Bob Barr . Your nation is counting on you! 
[ Shhh...quit snickering, you guys, I think they're buyin' it. ] Cheers and Jeers starts in There's Moreville... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!] :: 
Cheers and Jeers for Monday, June 2, 2008
Note: Rules and bylaws?  We don't need no stinkin' rules and bylaws!

Your Monday Texan As A Second Language Lesson
Brought to you by the 2008 Netroots Nation Convention in Austin July 17-20:

Say this phrase three times out loud before you go to bed and you'll be fluent in Texan in no time!

Puppy Pic of the Day:   Good mom

CHEERS to June.  Dad and the flag get their day, gay pride breaks out across the country (June 16-22 here), Barack Obama crosses the finish line, and rumor has it summer starts this month in states south and west of Maine.  Oh, and a special message from our black flies : "Come on up!  We'd love to have ya for a drink."
CHEERS to steady hands.  Ted Kennedy is undergoing brain surgery today at Duke University Medical Center.  You may commence holding your breath...now.
Next, please read both C&J options below three times each and then choose the one that best reflects your views:
CHEERS to Barack Obama.  At the Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting Saturday his team brokered a generous compromise, even setting himself back by 24 delegates.  Plus he urged protestors to stay away so that the process could run its course unimpeded by noisy distractions.  He sure is a uniter!
Or...
JEERS to Barack Obama.  His goons marched in and STOLE the nomination from Hillary!  I can't believe how the yellow-bellied committee members marched in lockstep to crown the black guy king.  Democrats suck!  I'm voting for McCain instead of that untested divider!
(I don't really care which one you picked.  I just needed the extra time to go poopies.  I feel better, thanks.  Let's move on...)
JEERS to the modern definition of progress.  Oh look, everybody!  In May only 19 of our soldiers and 505 Iraqi civilians died for a mistake .  Their families must be jumping for joy at the good news.  And that smell?  I'm baking a victory pie!
CHEERS to Puerto Rico!  The people have spoken!  The number-crunching is over!  The results are certified!  Aaaaaaand...90 percent of Americans still can't locate it on a map.
CHEERS to the Maine event.  Our state democratic convention wrapped up yesterday, and Obama got his 15 delegates (including a very happy Kossack ), and Hillary got her nine (it would've been ten if her campaigners had gotten the urinal signs up faster ).  Illinois Senator Dick Durbin gave the keynote speech and talked crazy talk :
The U.S. Senate's No. 2 leader told Maine Democrats on Saturday that with the presidential primaries near a conclusion, it's time for the party to unify behind one candidate.  "Soon, the primaries and caucuses will come to an end.  As of Tuesday, all of the states and territories will have voted. And at that point, it is time for us to start to unite as a party." 
But here's the best part: we smoked the Republicans!  We had nearly 4,000 attendees, versus 2,500 at their convention where the biggest draw was Susan Collins playing "My Baloney Has A First Name..." on the hurdy gurdy.  I never thought I'd reach this point, but not a day goes by lately where I don’t stop and say to myself, "Sucks to be them."  And every time I do my acid reflux disappears.
Breaking Update: Obama actually gained a national delegate from Maine, says the Portland Press Herald .  The seven-pound lobster from Harpswell called for party unity and said she was looking forward to shaking claws in Denver.
JEERS to premature departures.  Yves Saint Laurent has died at 71 .  Now what'll I wear?
JEERS to sinful distractions.  Crazy Muslim terrorist Barack Obama, stung by one too many preachers who left their brains at the door on Sunday morning, turned in his Trinity UCC membership card over the weekend.  Now the question is, which church will he move to?  I'd suggest he give my denomination a try.  We always have the best pancake suppers in the world .  Hence the saying: Once you try an Episcopalian flapjack, ya never go back.
CHEERS to the Bee king.  A thirteen year-old West Lafayette kid with the traditional Indiana name Sameer Mishra took top prize in the National Spelling Bee Friday, correctly spelling "Guerdon" (pronounced "GR-dn").  If you're wondering what it means, the answer is: a little over forty thousand bucks.
P.S. Funniest moment of the night was when Mishra confused a word meaning a sheepskin pad with Bill O'Reilly .  He later apologized to all the sheepskin pads in the world and promised it wouldn't happen again.
CHEERS to happy days.  Sixteen years ago today, Bill Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination for president.  His opponents accepted his winning delegate count, wished him well, and went on to campaign for him and unify the party.  C&J has three words for the next 48 hours: History, repeat thyself .
JEERS to phony outrage.  Lost in all the Scott McClellan hubbub is the fact that the White House had a month to review an advance copy of his book, Sorry I Was Such A Dick , and had no problems with it.  Oh, what the hell, let's all say it together: "Puzzling!"  
JEERS to addictive mergers.  Twenty three years ago today, The R.J. Reynolds Company proposed a major merger with Nabisco that would create a $4.9 billion conglomerate of food and tobacco products.  Which explains why 22 years ago I had to resort to the nicotine patch to wean myself off a sudden addiction to Fig Newtons.
-
One Year Ago in C&J: June 2, 2007...
JEERS to Surge MANIA!  One hundred and twenty five U.S. soldiers died for a mistake in May, making it the third-deadliest month since major combat operations started over four years ago.  But fear not, America...Iraq's prime minister has comforting words :
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said Thursday that his country's forces would be able to assume security command by June 2007," which could allow the United States to start withdrawing its troops.   "I can tell you that from our side our forces will be ready by June 2007," Maliki told ABC television.
It will come as no surprise to you that he said that six months (1 Friedman Unit) ago, on November 30, 2006.  Time flies when you're cowering in the Green Zone.
CHEERS to DeathMatch '08, Round 2!  Don’t forget about the Democratic presidential debate Sunday at 7 on CNN.  According to Blue Hampshire, Bill Richardson says sparks will fly because the candidates will be able to ask each other questions.  It's all building up to the final debate next January when they'll give each other polygraph tests while their nipples are wired to a car battery.  And they say we're the mommy party???
-
And just one more...
CHEERS to hangin' with the haters.  Saturday a gaggle of Kossacks---including myself and my better half, Common Sense Mainer---descended on the Massachusetts home of Brillig and Mik for an afternoon of Satanic rituals, Nazi speeches, games of Pin the Conscience on the Vice President , and burgers, burgers, burgers!  Thanks to everyone who turned out, including Sardonyx, 42, tnichlsn, Sobermom, Mem from Somerville, Stranded Wind, Simple, DtheO, AnotherMassachusettsLiberal, AlanF, Thestral, Sharoney, and AnnElizabeth.  Oh, and to the pilot of the black helicopter who circled overhead the entire time: sorry we got coleslaw on your windshield---we were aiming for your balls.  Next stop on the C&J rave circuit: Austin!
-
Oh, and Father Michael Pfleger: with all due respect, you're a dick .  Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?

TITLE: The Definition of Insanity


TEXT:

The Definition of Insanity by DarkSyde Thu May 29, 2008 at 04:30:26 PM PDT
So, the right-wing's response to McClellan's confirmations of deceit and duplicity seems to be coalescing around, "This sure doesn't sound like the Scottie I knew ..."  I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean or how they hope it will provide cover for their man Bush: should Scottie's head be scanned for slithering alien worms and his closet checked for body-snatching pods? Whatever, we can slap it down right now: It doesn't matter if McClellan was motived by money or revenge or a whole chorus of little Gaelic voices singing in his head. The former press Secretary has merely confirmed what we all knew already by the embarrassing truckload and that has conservative apologists squirming like slimy, salted snails (Apologies to innocent mollusks the world over). Of course, McClellan actually has the temerity to blame the media for letting his boss get away with all that shit. David Gregory to the rescue!

Well, shucks Stretch! If you and your fellow Warriors for Truth really want to demonstrate their integrity going forward, the opportunity to restore that sorely needed credibility is sitting right in front of your studio made up faces: 
Glenn Greenwald -- The Pentagon has posted to its website the roughly 8,000 pages and audio tapes it was forced to provide to the New York Times regarding its "military analyst" program. Anyone who reads through them, as I've now done, can only be left with one conclusion (other than being extremely impressed with David Barstow's work in putting together this story): if this wasn't an example of an illegal, systematic "domestic propaganda campaign" by the Pentagon, then nothing is. 
Here we have a story with almost everything any 'serious news' outlet could possibly want right at the time they need it most. It's been reported already, so there's little work and no risk involved, it concerns the entire electorate on the most pressing foriegn policy issue facing the nation during an election year, Congress may soon conduct an investigation into it, if true it's at the very least unethical and perhaps blatantly illegal, it's organized and vast; most important of all for the media incredulity vis-a-vie the Bush administration and Iraq, it involves, well, the integrity of the media regarding the Bush administration and Iraq. Best of all, those same Serious and Responsible new outfits have some of the allegedly corrupt military analysts on their payroll and/or under contract, some of them no doubt sitting happy and fat in a corner newsroom office. All a reporter has to do is walk a few hundred feet at most with camera and mic in hand and, you know, and ask the analyst about it. Wow, shouldn't be too hard to do some hard-hitting, investigative journalmalism, eh?  
And yet for over a month there's been nary a peep about it on those very cable news stations that are under assault, and now righteously defending themsselves, for lazy, sloppy, and naive reporting in the recent past. My question to them: the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. So, traditional media, who's running your asylum? ::

TITLE: Book Review: Kevin Phillips' "Bad Money"


TEXT:

Book Review: Kevin Phillips' "Bad Money" by SusanG Sun May 25, 2008 at 06:00:10 AM PDT
Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism By Kevin Phillips Viking,  New York, 2008 256 pages $25.95
Money is "bad," in the historical sense, when a leading world economic power passing its zenith—before the United States, think Hapsburg Spain, the maritime Dutch Republic (when New York was New Amsterdam), and imperial Britain just before World War I—lets itself luxuriate in finance at the expense of harvesting, manufacturing, or transporting things. Doing so has marked each nation's global decline. To institutionalize the dominance of minimally regulated finance at this stage of U.S. history is a bad idea.
...
... prior eminence of the United States in petroleum matters has left not only an outdated infrastructure but a spectrum of disabilities, unwarranted smugness, vested interests, and booby traps. These range from currency vulnerabilities and lack of a serious national energy strategy to apparent policy inertia in Washington, where many officeholders seem unable to understand how much has changed for the United States over the last decade.
...
Let me underscore: except tangentially, this book is not about elections. It is about the insecurity of America's future as the leading world economic power, given a debt-gorged and negligent financial sector, and the vulnerability caused by the nation's expensive dependence on imported oil. 
Kevin Phillips, author of bestsellers   American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury and American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush , turns his full attention to the economy in his latest book, and the news he brings is—not to surprise you or anything—bad.
Bad Money looks at the big picture, the thinking and policies behind what Atrios has come to label so endearingly Big Shitpile , the meltdown of the mortgage industry. Phillips adds to the pile by drawing in the entire financial sector for examination and the explosion of poorly understood "financial vehicles" that make up the get-rich-quick schemes that the captains of industry (particularly the financial industry) have been pushing for the past few years. He takes a lap or two around the oil crisis and ties it altogether in a neat, albeit depressing, package. :: 
Don't come to the book expecting in-depth definitions of the complicated investment instruments that have made the news of late (CBO's, for example). Phillips provides very quick and cursory sketches of the complex details of individual financial shenanigans; indeed, as the author makes clear, one of the problems is the dizzying multiplication of ill-understood alphabet combinations that even the sales reps don't understand when they pitch them. One thing, however, has become increasingly clear: America doesn't make shit anymore. And it's one of the major factors leading to our economic decline, even if no one wants to talk much about it. Selling each other--and overseas investors--our public and private debt is more than a risky business. According to Phillips, it's killing us off, both economically and politically.
Bingeing on debt is reckless, and financialization has a long record of being an unhealthy late state in the trajectory of previous leading world economic powers. Moving money around instead of making things is always dicey, and the U.S. transformation has been the most grandiose to date. 
While we've heard quite a bit from economists and politicians over the past decade bemoaning the public deficit, Phillips believes the bigger threat to national economic health by far is the overlooked explosion of private debt. Sure, America, has always borrowed (at least in the past century) to spur economic growth and long-term investment in industry and infrastructure. But the nature of more recent borrowing is alarming on multiple levels, largely related to ... well, we don't make shit anymore.
The debt the United States has been piling on in the last few years has provided only 30-40 percent as much stimulus per dollar to the national economy as did the debt added twenty-five or forty years ago. Why? Because money borrowed in 1970 or 1984 to be spent on factories, new jet fighter aircraft, teachers, or interstate highways had a lot more grassroots impact than money borrowed by tend thousand hedge funds to double the leverage of their various self-serving speculations. 
In other words, money borrowed today isn't filtering down through the economy to provide jobs, and it certainly isn't being put to use in any way that is helping to stabilize the dollar. Which leads, as most financial paths do these days, to our reliance on oil and our relations with the oil-producing nations. The weakening dollar is part of what's feeding the rise in oil prices as OPEC nations, years ago convinced to make the dollar the currency that prices were pegged to, find themselves compelled to charge more because of its devaluation, which in turn leads to more domestic pain, which in turn leads to more devaluation and so on.
And in the midst of this painful spiral, America has been quietly busy fiddling with leading economic indicators and measurements (what Phillips straightforwardly calls "gimmicks"), which understandably leaves potential investors leery of investing in propping up our sputtering economic engine. In particular, he points to the jerry-rigging of the Consumer Price Index and the jiggering of the "standard of living":
The current interlacing of gimmicks, by contrast, far from representing the costs of a constant standard of living, has been described by critics as measuring downward mobility—an index that, in the words of one, "more closely represents the costs of holding to an ever declining standard of living," such as a family shifting between hamburger, pork, and chicken depending on the price. 
Shamefully, a lot of the "new" ways of measuring the standard of living just happen to make it easier to declare wage and Social Security increases tied to that standard unnecessary. Because, you know, if you take food and gas out of the picture, there's not much increase, eh?
Phillips has come up with a name for this nexus of borrowing madness, false hype, ill-understood investments and outright lying through economic measurements: Bullnomics. And one of the most original and thoughtful observations Phillips makes in the book centers around the political purpose (or at the very least, desirable unexpected consequence) of Bullnomics: the stilling of a historical voice in American politics that has given the "investment class" the heebie-jeebies for a couple of centuries. Behold the silencing of economic populism:
Beyond homage to financial assets and market efficiency, along with reliance on misleading government statistics, Bullnomics as a discernible political and economic force had a third, little appreciated, dimension. This was the de facto anesthetizing, over the last twenty years, of onetime populist southern and western constituencies prominent in the George W. Bush-era conservative coalition. The principal ethers at work were evangelical, fundamentalist, and Pentecostal Christianity, infused with a millennial preoccupation with terrorism, evil, and Islam that greatly strengthened after September 11. 
Mix it all together, in other words, and you've got a couple of pretty big regions of the country with residents who don't care what the Wall Street masters of the universe are cooking up as long as the Armageddon train is on schedule, terrorists are kept at bay and fetuses are sanctified through legislation. And it isn't just citizens who've decided not to pay attention. Even those evil, supposedly far-seeing entities, the multi-national oil companies, have been slow on the uptake of the new brash economy as well--although not for the same reasons--and the results are another factor in the pull-down of the economy:
The extent to which the United States has a dated, ghost-of-glories-past petroleum infrastructure is all too evident. The major U.S. oil companies, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, are wealthy but aging behemoths, hard-pressed to maintain production levels, despite large exploration outlays, and no longer enjoying the access to overseas oil fields they once commanded. 
One pictures huge, dull-eyed brontosauruses standing knee-deep in a marsh of oil muck after that description. This aspect of Phillips' writing, in both his current and past works, has received less attention than it deserves--his sharp eye for metaphors really bring what could be a dolefully complex and dull subject to life. Take this explanation, for an example: "Since the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 dissolved old legal separations and constraints, commercial banking, insurance, securities, and mortgage lending have intertwined like tossed four-colored linguine in a bowl." Such examples abound throughout, and make the book a much breezier read than expected.
Still, the message conveyed is a sobering one. Two final thoughts stand out at the conclusion. One has to do with the unwillingness of the wishful-thinking American electorate (and its candidates) to hear the bad news and truly begin to grapple with its consequences, or to have a serious discussion about lessening its impact.
[Peak oil] is not a happy message. The economics are precarious, the geopolitics is dangerous, but the domestic U.S. politics stand to be awful. If a loosely defined peak, instead of being ten to fifteen years away—which leaves some time for innovation—is actually close at hand, the inadequacies of latter-day American governance could become as important as any geological challenge or technological solution. 
The other realization is how desperate is the need for regulation in what Phillips likens to the Wild West of finance. Even the people selling these convoluted securities don't understand them. Yet when they crash and burn, the taxpayer provides the bail out, creating a ridiculous situation in which the bigger and less accountable you are, the more rewarded are your failures. Phillips soundly declares, "If banks are to be rescued because they are too big to fail, they must also become, in the manner of a regulated public utility, too suitably behaved and too responsible to fail."
This book represents a terrific start on understanding the interplay between past policy, current risk, energy and investments. Without such clear-eyed explanation and thinking, it's hard to see how we're going to move ahead and try to find solutions in the hard times that seem inevitable ahead.

TITLE: Obama Picking Up Republican Donors


TEXT:

Obama Picking Up Republican Donors by Hunter Sat May 31, 2008 at 01:27:46 PM PDT
In non-committee-meeting news, McClatchy reports ...
Beverly Fanning is among the campaign donors who'll be joining President Bush at a gala at Washington's Ford's Theater Sunday night, but she says that won't dissuade her from her current passion: volunteering for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.
She isn't the only convert. A McClatchy computer analysis, incomplete due to the difficulty matching data from various campaign finance reports, found that hundreds of people who gave at least $200 to Bush's 2004 campaign have donated to Obama.
Among them are Julie Nixon Eisenhower, the granddaughter of the late GOP president Dwight Eisenhower; Connie Ballmer, the wife of Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer; Ritchie Scaife, the estranged wife of conservative tycoon Richard Mellon Scaife and boxing promoter Don King.
Many of the donors are likely "moderate Republicans or independents who are dissatisfied with the direction of the country now and are looking for change," said Anthony Corrado, a government professor at Colby College in Maine who specializes in campaign finance. 
I do wonder about this, for McCain. It's certainly true that his fundraising has been dampened by generally poor spirits, among Republicans -- but actual party-switching among donors, how much will that impact things? No clue.

Montana Supers to Commit Tonight by SusanG Tue Jun 03, 2008 at 08:55:45 AM PDT
... and all signs point to Obama picking them up :
Gov. Brian Schweitzer as well as Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester have agreed to all endorse the winner of Montana's primary -- almost certain to be Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) -- immediately upon the contest being called. The trio will be joined in the endorsement by state party chairman Dennis McDonald and vice chairman Margaret Campbell.
Polling, as well as conversations with strategists for both sides, suggest Obama enters today's Montana primary as a clear favorite. An American Research Group survey put Obama's lead over Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton at 48 percent to 44 percent but a Mason-Dixon survey showed Obama with a wider 52 percent to 35 percent lead.  ::

Open Thread for Night Owls & Early Birds by Meteor Blades Wed May 28, 2008 at 10:15:45 PM PDT
It ought to be good news, wonderful news, in fact. The BBC reports that more than 100 of the world's countries have agreed to ban the current designs of cluster bombs.
Just one problem. The United States, Russia and China are opposed. No surprise. They are the biggest producers of these weapons. Indeed, they didn't even show up at the 10-day conference in Dublin to make their case. Just thumbed their noses at the whole affair. The three prefer voluntary (read: laughable) controls as well as voluntary efforts to clean up millions of these bomblets, which kill or maim civilians from Cambodia to Lebanon, sometimes years, even decades, after they are dropped.
Cluster bombs are delivered by artillery or aircraft. Each releases hundreds of mini-bomblets that are supposed to explode upon impact. But failure rates are immense. For instance, when Israel and Hezbollah went to war in southern Lebanon two years ago, as many as 40 percent of the bomblets failed. Perhaps a million of these lethal explosives remained scattered around after the fighting stopped. When they do explode, chances are close to 50-50 that they will kill a child aged 5 to 15.
In addition to the Cheney-Bush Administration's opposition to any international ban, the Pentagon is trying to keep Congress from passing the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act . So far, that effort has succeeded. The bill, S. 594, was introduced 16 months ago by Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Mikulski. It has 18 co-sponsors . Neither Sen. Clinton nor Senator Obama have joined them. The bill states:
No funds appropriated or otherwise available to any Federal department or agency may be obligated or expended to use, sell, or transfer any cluster munitions unless--
(1) the submunitions of the cluster munitions have a 99 percent or higher functioning rate;
(2) the policy applicable to the use, or the agreement applicable to the sale or transfer, of such cluster munitions specifies that the cluster munitions will only be used against clearly defined military targets and will not be used where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians; and
(3) not later than 30 days after such cluster munitions are used, the President submits to the appropriate congressional committees a plan, including estimated costs, for cleaning up any such cluster munitions and submunitions which fail to explode and continue to pose a hazard to civilians ... 
ScottyUrb reminds me that the companion bill in the House, with 27 co-sponsors, is here .
Next time you talk with or e-mail one of your Senators or Representatives, or your favorite presidential candidate, request that they co-sponsor this bill.

Midday Open Thread by mcjoan Sat May 31, 2008 at 11:24:26 AM PDT Atrios celebrated Suck on This day yesterday, the 5th anniversary of Tom Friedman going on Charlie Rose and telling the world that the Iraq war was fought to tell Iraqis to "Suck On This"... because we could! 
Little Tommy kept soldiering on, hunting for ponies in his little fantasy war. And every few months or so, Little Tommy's moustache would communicate to him that the next six months were critical, or important, or whatever. Little Tommy kept punting the problem down the road six months at a time, and over 10 Friedman Units later people are still dying. Even in his little fantasy war Tommy couldn't find the pony. 
Thanks for the reminder, Atrios.
Rolling Stone has a infuriatingly good article on the state of the Democratic Senate. Read the whole thing, but this critique from former Republican senator Chafee is particularly striking: 
Even some Republicans are bewildered by the failure of Senate Democrats to stand up to the White House. "When you see a headline like 'In The Senate, A White House Victory On Eavesdropping,' something is wrong," says Lincoln Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island who was ousted from the Senate in 2006 by voters who believed a Democratic majority would take on the Bush administration. "We threw out all these incumbents for a reason. But there's been no discernible change in direction."
Instead, Chafee says, Senate Democrats caved to Bush on wiretapping because they're still "skittish" about being tagged as soft on terror. Reid and the Democrats, he says, need to "draw a line on what's more sacred: short-term thinking about a possible terrorist attack, or the long-term ramifications of undoing our Constitution." 

Today in torture : 
A judge hearing a war crimes case at Guantanamo Bay who publicly expressed frustration with military prosecutors' refusal to give evidence to the defense has been dismissed, tribunal officials confirmed Friday. 
Let the show trials commence, timed to influence the general election . Because is sure as hell isn't about justice.
This is both fun and scary , a look at how television influenced the CIA. The "Cone of Silence," from Get Smart ? Yup. The same with the pen communicator from The Man from U.N.C.L.E.
Lexington, KY has a dubious new distinction , the largest carbon footprint among all of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas.
World hunger, just another opportunity , in the minds of BushCo, to line the pockets of a few more gigantic corporations. Let them eat GMO biofuels.
The 81st annual Scripps National Spelling Bee is now history, with Sameer Mishra , a 13-year-old from Indiana, winning with the correct spelling of "guerdon," which means "a reward." Congrats, Sameer.
Killer observation from Sisyphus Shrugged noting that Bob Dole's full of it: 
Dole assures McClellan that he won't read the book -- "because if all these awful things were happening, and perhaps some may have been, you should have spoken up publicly like a man, or quit your cushy, high profile job"
"That would have taken integrity and courage but then you would have had credibility and your complaints could have been aired objectively," Dole concludes. 
...says the RNC Chair who presided over Watergate. [ Kagro X ] ::

TITLE: House and Senate Roundup, 5/27

House and Senate Roundup, 5/27 by brownsox Tue May 27, 2008 at 12:30:18 PM PDT
Senate Races
KY-Sen : For those who missed it earlier, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is, according to Rasmussen, in serious danger of "getting Daschled" .
Rasmussen has released a poll showing McConnell's Democratic opponent, Bruce Lunsford, beating Kentucky's senior Senator and the Republicans' dear Leader. And Lunsford doesn't enjoy a slim lead, either; he's ahead by five points, 49% to 44%.
Yes, it's one poll.
Yes, it's only the latest in a series of surprisingly, often shockingly favorable Rasmussen polls, and it's quite substantially different from all other recent polling (including McConnell's own internals , which aren't great, but have him with a substantial lead).
No, Lunsford isn't the greatest.
Yes, there are five months to go, and McConnell is a ruthless campaigner with a campaign war chest comparable to Fort Knox.
We're still going to Daschle him.
MN-Sen : Meanwhile, over in Minnesota, Al Franken is rebounding nicely , according to Rasmussen (so often the bearer of delicious news lately).
They have Coleman leading Franken, 47% to 45%, obviously within the margin of error.
Obama leads McCain 53% to 38% in Minnesota, so perhaps in an effort to save his own skin, Coleman is trying to close that gap by pushing Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty onto McCain's ticket. Yes, the Tim Pawlenty who won reelection by one percentage point in 2006.
MT-Sen : Nothing to see here, folks. Democratic Sen. Max Baucus is thrashing his chief opponent, Mike Lange, 65% to 26%.
The Republicans are still hoping that some bizarre set of circumstances could give them a chance at this seat, and I hope they continue to do so. It's eminently worth their money. Really, it is.
PA-Sen 2010 : Take this with several thousand grains of salt, but thinks Ed Rendell might run for Arlen Specter's Senate seat in 2010.
There might be something to it, but I suspect it's just bloviation. All previous indications from Rendell were that he was done with running for office, and I doubt that Rendell, who will be 66 years old in 2010, will feel it especially necessary for either himself or the party that he take on such a race. And I definitely wonder whether Rendell would be happy as a freshman Senator, after eighteen years of being top dog, first as Philadelphia Mayor, then Governor.
It's possible that Rendell sees his chances for a Cabinet position disappearing due to Obama's winning the nomination (Rendell was a big Hillary Clinton supporter), and as such, he's considering other options. But even so, I seriously doubt he's going to run.
House Races
CA-04 : The best spectator sport in Northern California this spring, except on days when Tim Lincecum is pitching for the Giants, has been the Republican primary race in California's Fourth District.
Conservative Icon Tom McClintock (by now I am convinced that that is actually part of his name) squares off against non-Conservative Icon and former Representative Doug Ose, and the candidates are getting pretty feisty, firing not just at each other, but at the Republican Party in general :
Entertained enough to stay glued to fold-out chairs for two hours, voters in this winsome Gold Rush town recently watched the top Republicans in California's hottest congressional race rip apart their own party for plundering the treasury, caving in to environmentalists and opening the borders.
The most venomous attacks came from state Sen. Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks, who has ventured north to run on his statewide reputation as a ramrod conservative. McClintock's swipes were intended to yoke top rival Doug Ose, a former Republican congressman from Sacramento, to the scorn voters hold for Washington.
"The government is not our nanny, and the national treasury is not a grab-bag for pork-barrel earmarks," McClintock told a packed house during a candidates forum in the town's Veteran's Memorial Building. He added that he was especially ashamed of the unchecked spending when Republicans controlled Congress. 
McClintock is always great for radical right-wing ire, but Ose isn't being much friendlier:
Ose, a wealthy real estate developer who represented the neighboring Sacramento district from 1999 to 2006, has used close to $1.5 million of his own fortune to flood the airwaves and mailboxes with ads deriding McClintock as a hypocrite for collecting a government paycheck for two decades while he preached against the ills of big government.
"For 22 years, Tom McClintock has been representing Los Angeles in the Legislature, but now terms limits are forcing him out, so he's shopping for a new job," one of Ose's more cheeky television ads says.
Ose also is quick to remind voters that McClintock is registered to vote in Thousand Oaks -- though he lives in Elk Grove, near Sacramento -- and can't even cast a ballot for himself in the primary. 
Meanwhile, Blue Majority candidate Charlie Brown is just chillin' on the sidelines, sitting on five times the cash of either of these Republican beauties.
AK-AL : CQ Politics has an article on Alaska's U.S. House race, which focuses on the possibility that scandal-plagued incumbent Don Young might lose his primary to Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell.
Parnell is no stranger to challenging old guard Republicans in the state. He appeared on Palin’s winning ticket when she ousted incumbent Republican. Gov. Frank H. Murkowski two years ago.
Parnell said there are clear similarities between his current House campaign and the 2006 election, which Murkowski, a longtime politician, entered with low approval ratings.
Parnell is campaigning on issues such as resource development, job creation, the nation’s economy, establishing a natural gas pipeline and fixing high gas prices, in addition to what he calls "restoring trust issues," all things on which Parnell believes he can be more effective than the congressman.
"Voters appreciate the years he’s given, but we also think it’s time for new leadership," Parnell said of Young. 
As CQ notes, that would be bad for Democrats. Should Young survive his primary, which isn't until the end of the summer, he will face a stiff challenge from Democrat Ethan Berkowitz, who leads him by ten points. However, Parnell would be well positioned to defeat Berkowitz if he won the nomination. Parnell is strongly backed by his boss, Alaska's uber-popular Governor Sarah Palin, and represents something of a good-government alternative to the woefully corrupt Alaska Republican establishment.
I agree that this race has some uncomfortable similarities to the 2006 Governor's race, when Democrat Tony Knowles consistently led Governor Frank Murkowski in polling until Murkowski was toppled by Palin, who then coasted to a six-point victory over Knowles.
NM-01, NM-02, NM-03 : With the New Mexico Congressional primary coming up, the Democratic races for each of the state's three House seats are starting to take shape.
In the First District, likely to be the most competitive race in the fall, Martin Heinrich holds a substantial polling lead in the Democratic primary, and has a clear edge at this point over former Secretary of State Rebecca Vigil Giron and state Health Secretary Michelle Lujan Grisham.
In the Republican-leaning Second District, former Lea County Commissioner Harry Teague faces Dona Ana County Commissioner Bill McCamley, and in the solidly Democratic Third District, Public Regulation Commissioner Ben Lujan has a slight edge over real estate developer Don Wiviott.
Teague and Lujan are expecting a high-profile endorsement in the coming days, which could perhaps tip the scales in their favor:
Gov. Bill Richardson (D) is expected to endorse former Lea County Commissioner Harry Teague over Doña Ana County Commissioner Bill McCamley in the 2nd district Democratic primary, and state Public Regulation Commissioner Ben Lujan over wealthy Santa Fe homebuilder Don Wiviott in the 3rd district. Those endorsements could prove critical in the final days.
Despite his unsuccessful White House bid earlier this year, Richardson remains popular at home. He was due to endorse Teague and Lujan "any day," according to sources at press time on Friday.
Lujan is the son of state Speaker Ben Lujan (D), and the support he garners from the Hispanic Democratic machine in the 3rd district could be too much for the more than $1.3 million in personal funds that Wiviott had spent on the race as of a week ago. 
Primary day is June 3, so stay tuned... ::

I like dictatorship! And so do you, if you know what's good for you! by Kagro X Mon May 26, 2008 at 10:00:14 AM PDT
You do too. Trust me, you do. Just nod. You don't want to know what happens if you don't nod.
Al-Marri's capture six years ago might be the Bush administration's biggest domestic counterterrorism success story. Authorities say he was an al-Qaida sleeper agent living in middle America, researching poisonous gasses and plotting a cyberattack.
To justify holding him, the government claimed a broad interpretation of the president's wartime powers, one that goes beyond warrantless wiretapping or monitoring banking transactions. Government lawyers told federal judges that the president can send the military into any U.S. neighborhood, capture a citizen and hold him in prison without charge, indefinitely.
Yes, that's what your government's lawyers tell federal judges when push comes to shove, and they have to own up to the ultimate ramifications of what they're arguing. They really are willing to stand there and tell judges that the president can send the military to disappear anyone he wants, so long as he's willing to say that person is an enemy combatant. 
The full appeals court is reviewing that decision and a ruling is expected soon. During arguments last year, government lawyers said the courts should give great deference to the president when the nation is at war.
"What you assert is the power of the military to seize a person in the United States, including an American citizen, on suspicion of being an enemy combatant?" Judge William B. Traxler asked.
"Yes, your honor," Justice Department lawyer Gregory Garre replied. 
And who are you to say different, citizen?
Nobody. Exactly. I thought not. Go on about your business.
(Psst! Over here! Keep it down, though. Were you wondering where they say they derive this power from? Well, it's the AUMF.)
"The president is not a king and cannot lock people up forever in the United States based on his say-so," said Jonathan Hafetz, a lawyer who represents al-Marri and other detainees. "Today it's Mr. al-Marri. Tomorrow it could be you, a member of your family, someone you know. Once you allow the president to lock people up for years or even life without trial, there's no going back."
Glenn Sulmasy, a national security fellow at Harvard, said the issue comes down to whether the nation is at war. Soldiers would not need warrants to launch a strike against invading troops. So would they need a warrant to raid an al-Qaida safe house in a U.S. suburb?
Sulmasy says no. That's how Congress wrote the bill and "if they feel concerned about civil liberties, they can tighten up the language," he said. 
So, how are we doing on "tightening up" that language?
Mmmm, not so hot. But mabye we can cave in on FISA first, and then talk about the AUMF.
What? FISA again? Yes, FISA again. Why FISA again? Because the Bush "administration" says the AUMF authorized both its illegal domestic spying program and its powers to invade your neighborhood and disappear your sorry ass on the president's say-so.
And just for fun, here's an interesting observation from a comment by entlord1 in an earlier diary: Bush claims the power to make a warrantless arrest of anyone, anywhere at any time, and argues in court that the power is derived from Congress (though John Yoo always argued the power was inherent in the presidency, which, while even crazier, is at least an internally consistent if powerfully stupid argument). Meanwhile, Congress pretends it has no independent power to enforce its own lawful subpoenas.
Gosh, that must have been some powerful piece of legislation! Better be careful with what you say it authorizes, Congress! Since you're actually contemplating giving the retroactive thumbs-up to the spying part, you might want to give a minute to what this crazy-ass "administration" is going to say that means about the warrantless military seizure and secret, indefinite detention of pretty much anyone the president says he doesn't like a whole lot.
Maybe. Sorta. If it's not too much trouble, and you don't think it will maybe make Republicans attack you in ads.
Otherwise, forget it. We'll just shop and wear our flag pins. ::

Open Thread for Night Owls & Early Birds (Movie Edition) by Meteor Blades Wed Jun 04, 2008 at 10:00:09 PM PDT
While we ponder whether she really means it this time, whether her advisers and friends and colleagues and maybe even her daughter and husband have persuaded her that, yes, 2187 delegates is more than 2117, perhaps it's time to take a momentary breather from the politics of the past 16 months and go after each other tooth and nail on another subject, the movies. Or as some of my high-falutin' friends prefer to say: film.
In this arena, Harry Brighouse and other folks over at Crooked Timber have been having fun with a thread called: 101 Movies to avoid watching before you die.
Harry particularly hates The House of Sand and Fog , about which - in the most charitable section of his excoriation - he says:
I rarely dislike a movie enough to warn people against it, but this is one of the worst, and most unpleasant, movies I’ve watched. (I see that someone has vandalised the wikipedia entry on this one, saying, hilariously, that it and some of its actors were nominated for awards!) 
In the past three days, more than 400 commenters have dropped in with their personal unfavorites, or, as a poster named Wilson labels them, decommendations, including: The Lake House, My Dinner with Andre, Boxing Helena, The Golden Compass, Eyes Wide Shut, Dogma, Star Wars (any of them), Van Helsing, Ghost Dog, Kingdom of Heaven, Leaving Las Vegas, E.T. - The Extraterrestrial, Dead Poets Society, Wolf Creek ...
You get the idea.
Commenter ck dexter , who I suspect, says film , not movies , opines:
This is an embarrassing and disheartening thread. Like a first year undergrad discussion. "Plato sucks! He’s hard and boring!"
I note two surprising and particularly saddening trends: The tendency to list arguably mediocre films that made an effort to be good, but that are thought by many knowledgeable people to be very good. And, at the same time, a tendency to defend choices (e.g., You’ve Got Mail ) that are equally mediocre, but try not to be more. To equate sad or depressing with "don’t watch it." Have I got a Disney library to sell you people.
At the very least, it’s a good argument in favor of respect for specialized expertise in knowledge, since clearly the high level of general intelligence doesn’t make its opinions about film any better than the average. 
OK, specialists and movie fans alike, what do you decommend we avoid before we die?
My personal unfavorite: The Searchers .

TITLE: House and Senate Roundup, 6/2


TEXT:

House and Senate Roundup, 6/2 by brownsox Mon Jun 02, 2008 at 02:17:42 PM PDT
LA-Sen : There are several good polls out today for the Republicans, as far as Senate races go. Chief among them is a Rasmussen poll showing Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu leading Republican challenger John Kennedy, 47% to 44%.
It is no secret that Louisiana is the Republicans' top pickup opportunity, by far; in fact, it is their only decent pickup opportunity in the Senate this year. Both of Landrieu's previous Senate races have been very close affairs, and it's not at all surprising that she is facing yet another tight race.
This is one of the first Rasmussen polls in quite some time to show legitimately good news for Republicans. GOP apologists spent a great deal of time last week decrying the utility of automated polling in the wake of a series of bad Rasmussen results; I simply can't wait to see them crowing about this poll.
NC-Sen : More good news, though hardly great news, for Republicans in North Carolina; incumbent Senator Elizabeth Dole leads her Democratic challenger, Kay Hagan, 47% to 39%, according to Public Policy Polling . In PPP's last poll, Dole led 48% to 43%.
There isn't much of a change in Dole's top line here, which is pretty good news for Democrats, actually. We can also take comfort in the fact that Hagan received just 50% of the black vote in this poll (to 23% for Dole), numbers which will almost certainly get far better for Hagan over time, particularly with Barack Obama as the Democratic candidate.
One of the oddest crosstabs of this poll; Dole performs best among voters aged 18-29. I'm frankly shocked by this.  
Republicans can take some comfort in this poll, but I don't think they should be getting too excited about Dole at 47%.
MA-Sen : Now, the good polling for Democrats. Sen. John Kerry is obliterating both his Republican opponents, Jeff Beatty and prize NRSC recruit Jim Ogonowski, by over 30 points.
Best of all, Kerry's unfavorables are polled at just 32%. Kerry's name recognition is obviously far higher than either of his opponents', yet his unfavorables are actually lower than Ogonowski's (NRSC chairman John Ensign picked a real stallion here, apparently), and only one point higher than Beatty's.
It's a sign of how mind-numbingly delusional John Ensign's NRSC is, that they seriously though Ogonowski had a shot at beating a man who received 59 million votes for the Presidency of the United States, on his own turf.
NM-Sen : On the eve of primary day in New Mexico, proud right-winger Steve Pearce leads faux moderate Heather Wilson, 45% to 39%, in their spirited battle to be the Republican sacrificial lamb nominee for U.S. Senate against Democrat Tom Udall. 
Wilson recently earned the endorsement of New Mexico's senior Senator, the retiring Pete Domenici. With the primary held tomorrow, however, it's unclear whether Domenici's belated support will make any difference, something he himself acknowledges:
Republican Senate candidate Steve Pearce is leading the primary race by 6 percentage points in the latest poll, but a belated endorsement for his opponent, Heather Wilson, by Sen. Pete Domenici has many wondering whether it will help her pull ahead before the primary election.
"It's very late. Is there enough time? I'm not sure," Domenici said Sunday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. 
We'll be watching the primary results as they come in tomorrow.
CO-Sen : Poor Bob Schaffer has been taking a lot of hits lately. First, it was over his relationship to Jack Abramoff. Second, there was his relationship to disgraced businessman Bill Orr, a former business colleague of Schaffer's who bilked Congress out of several million dollars while Schaffer was still a Member.
Now, he's taking criticism for his   lousy website
Republican Bob Schaffer's campaign for the US Senate has finally gotten a substantial website on the air. It's not a bad effort, to be honest, but doesn't match up to the site of his Democratic opponent Mark Udall by several measures.
The short version: Udall gets the web, Schaffer doesn't.
Schaffer's website is relatively small in content, and its navigation is simple and straightforward. The graphic design is a bit heavy-handed: you might get tired of the overlarge, ubiquitous page header picture of the grinning Schaffer clan (clearly) photoshopped in front of a grove of aspen, with the helpful caption "THE SCHAFFER FAMILY" in case you couldn't figure out who they were. What's worse - it's the only photograph on the website. There's also one video - a 12 second clip - also used on every page. Overall the site has a very flat feel. 
ME-Sen : Bonnie Raitt will be holding a concert for Senate candidate Tom Allen in August.
The singer and musician will play at Portland's Merrill Auditorium on Aug. 11.
In a statement released by Allen's campaign, Raitt is quoted as saying she supports Allen's stance on the war in Iraq, renewable and alternative energy sources, and climate change. 
Tickets go on sale Friday, on Allen's website.
House Races
NM-01, NM-02, NM-03 : Tomorrow is primary day in New Mexico, and in addition to the Republican Senate primary, there are contested Democratic primaries for each of the state's House seats.
In the Albuquerque-based First District, formerly home of Heather "Nipplegate" Wilson, Martin Heinrich is leading the Democratic pack over Rebecca Vigil Giron and Michelle Lujan Grisham, who had been considered Heinrich's strongest primary opponent. Heinrich has a solid lead, and while it's hard to predict exactly what will happen tomorrow, Heinrich is favored.
Tomorrow's winner will face Republican Darren White in one of the highest-profile races in the country.
In the Second District, Democrats Bill McCamley and Harry Teague are the front-runners in a primary that has gotten mildly unpleasant towards the end. This will probably be a second-tier race in November; it's a solidly Republican district, but a viable pickup opportunity in a Democratic year.
Finally, in the Third District, Democrats Ben Ray Lujan and Don Wiviott are topping the field in a crowded race to fill Tom Udall's seat, as he runs for Senate. Whoever takes the nomination tomorrow should cruise to victory in November.
CA-04 : On the eve of primary day in California, we are drawing near the end of one of the most prominent and most entertaining Republican primary races in the country, the Fourth District race between Conservative Icon Tom McClintock and "moderate" Doug Ose.
The New York Times has a fine article on the race:
The race, for one of only two open Congressional seats in the state, has intrigued Californians and raised hopes among Democrats nationwide that this might just be the year they flip a seat that for decades has been reliably Republican.
On the Republican side, the battle has pitted Tom McClintock, a well-known state legislator and frequent candidate, against Doug Ose, a former congressman. Their primary race has embroiled the state’s Republican Party over endorsement rules, and forced the residents of the state’s Fourth Congressional District — which runs from the eastern Sacramento suburbs to the Oregon border — to ponder why the two men wishing to represent them do not actually live among them.
Waiting in the general-election wings is Charlie Brown, a plain-spoken former Air Force helicopter pilot and Democrat whose support of gun rights and small-government-preaching attitude is probably nearer to Mr. Doolittle than to most members of his party. Mr. Brown came within 9,000 votes of unseating Mr. Doolittle in 2006.
"I spent most of my life as a registered Republican," Mr. Brown, 58, said. "The reason I’m running as a Democrat is the Democratic Party is allowing me to be myself."
Charlie Brown's campaign has released a poll showing him defeating both McClintock and Ose. He leads Ose 38% to 34%, and McClintock 42% to 40%.
This is remarkably impressive for an R+10.9 district, and speaks to Brown's likability as a candidate (he enjoys 36/18 favorable/unfavorables, to McClintock's 39/29 and Ose's 27/28).
FL-21, FL-25 : The Miami Herald reports that Florida Republicans Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart are strongly backing a bill that would put heavy money into the hands of a prosthetics company whose PAC, coincidentally, had given over $10,000 to the Diaz-Balarts' campaigns just weeks before.
The Diaz-Balarts say they are firmly behind providing better coverage for those needing prosthetic devices.
''It's the moral thing to do,'' Mario Diaz-Balart wrote.
Yet the ties between politicians and Hanger are so tight, say public watchdogs asked about the arrangement, they appear almost like partners.
''Members are here to serve the public interest and not the interests of a private corporation,'' said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Washington nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics.  ::

TITLE: Midday open thread


TEXT:

Midday open thread by kos Mon Jun 02, 2008 at 01:20:41 PM PDT Obama has now visited 48 states this election season. He has two left -- Alaska and Hawaii, and he'll hopefully hit them all before all's said and done.
 On the cover of Mark Penn's last book, Bill Clinton offers up this blurb: "The ideas in this book will help you see the world in a new way". Mark Penn's ideas, of course, led Hillary Clinton to defeat .
 You know that secret tape of Michelle Obama supposedly railing against "Whitey" that has the wingnuts and some of the fringiest Clinton supporters all excited? If BooMan is correct, it's a huge bust. And as a bonus, take a look at who is spreading the rumor . [update: link to Booman pulled since he's having server troubles.]
 Raise your hands if you love Drinking Liberally . 
Jesse is back . So, so cool.
 Your president, giving a pep talk to his national security team and generals: 
"Kick ass!" he quotes the president as saying. "If somebody tries to stop the march to democracy, we will seek them out and kill them! We must be tougher than hell! This Vietnam stuff, this is not even close. It is a mind-set. We can't send that message. It's an excuse to prepare us for withdrawal."
"There is a series of moments and this is one of them. Our will is being tested, but we are resolute. We have a better way. Stay strong! Stay the course! Kill them! Be confident! Prevail! We are going to wipe them out! We are not blinking!"
He told them to kick ass. It's not the president's fault that people didn't follow his orders, is it? 

 Kristol's contract at the NY Times apparently forbids the newspaper from editing or fact checking his column.
Along with all the people at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington DC for the DNC's Rules and Bylaws committee were people at the reception celebrating the wedding of Danielle DeBuchanann and Matt Rogers.  The newlyweds and their guests didn't let the raucousness outside the ballroom diminish their fun: 
"Matt and I were like, this is D.C., this is what you get when you live here," the new Mrs. Rogers, 26, a sales manager for a marketing company, told us yesterday. "That's why I wanted to have the wedding in the city -- this is why we have such a great country."
"We could let it ruin the wedding, or we could embrace it," said Rogers, 29, who works in finance with Accenture. "We embraced it." So when the protesters shouted, "Count the vote, count the vote!" and "Fifty states, not 48!" the bridesmaids came back with "Danielle and Matt in Oh-Eight!"
[...]
Back at their room, they were surprised by a huge platter of food, a nice bottle of champagne and a note: "Thank you so much for sharing your day with us." Signed: Howard Dean and the Democratic National Committee.

Michigan Proposal by DHinMI Sat May 31, 2008 at 03:59:27 PM PDT
Michigan proposal:  69 delegates for Clinton, 59 delegates for Obama.  Everyone, including superdelegates, gets a half vote.  
Harold Ickes, in ending his statement against the proposal: "Mrs Clinton has asked me to reserve her rights to take this to the credentials committee."  
In other words, Hillary Clinton announces her intent to possibly scorch the earth rather than act in the best interests of the party, the country and the world.  
Update by georgia10:  The text of the motion being debated:
Mame Reiley (VA) moves that all pledged delegate positions in Michigan be restored, provided that each pledged delegate shall be entitled to cast one-half vote, that the pledged delegate positions shall be allocated as follows: Senator Clinton, 69 delegates casting 34.5 votes, Senator Obama 59 delegates casting 29.5 votes. All unpledged delegates allocated by the call shall be entitled to cast one-half vote. The Michigan Democratic Party shall conduct a process to fill the pledged delegate positions in accordance with Rules 5, 6, 7 and 12 of the delegate selection rules, including candidate right of approval.  ::

TITLE: Dems Offer Stop-Loss Payment Bill


TEXT:

Dems Offer Stop-Loss Payment Bill by georgia10 Mon May 26, 2008 at 09:10:15 AM PDT
Democrats introduce a common-sense bill to compensate service members affected by the President's excessive use of the "stop loss" policy:
Service members whose military careers are involuntarily extended by stop-loss orders would be compensated $1,500 a month for each additional month of service under a bill introduced Friday in the Senate.
The bill, S 3060, would not only affect the estimated 4,000 soldiers now affected by stop-loss, but also would retroactively apply to the more than 58,000 people whose retirements have been delayed or whose enlistments have been extended because the services decided they were needed on active duty.
The $1,500 payment would be paid for serving even one day of a month beyond the period when service was supposed to end.
The average stop-loss has forced service members to remain on active duty for an additional 6.6 months, which means that the bill, if it were to become law, would result in average payments of $10,500 to those whose lives have been changed by the policy. 
The bill is being introduced by Senator Lautenberg (D-NJ) , and is cosponsored by Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Bob Casey (D-PA).
In 2004, when John Kerry was calling out President Bush on his abuse of the military's stop-loss policy, John McCain joined Kerry in calling the process a "backdoor draft." Stop-loss, McCain said, "a terrible thing for morale." Meanwhile, in this election season, John McCain's military advisor, Ralph Peters, has claimed that stop-loss is " a myth of the left ."
So how will the "new" John McCain vote on this bill, if he shows up to vote at all (let us remember that McCain failed to even show up for the vote on the Senator Webb's GI Bill). Given his track record, a "yes" vote from McCain on this would be a pleasant surprise. As Matthew Yglesias notes :
It's worth noting that not only did John McCain oppose Jim Webb's bill expanding educational benefits for veterans, but he has a long track record of fairly stingy behavior on veterans' issues. As Hilzoy puts it "McCain has supported basic appropriations for vets. However, when there are two competing proposals, he generally chooses the cheaper one, and often, when only one proposal to increase benefits is available, he opposes it."  ::

TITLE: Media-types straddle fence on McClellan


TEXT:

Media-types straddle fence on McClellan by Kagro X Thu May 29, 2008 at 07:05:27 PM PDT
Tucker Carlson, on the Scott McClellan "revelations," is typically duplicitous.

He's [McClellan] opening a whole new line of questioning, I think, that's important. Look, McCain's explanation you just heard is defensible: 'I support the war because I thought Saddam was going to hurt us, so we should hurt him first.' That's a reasonable point of view.
What's unreasonable in my view is what Scott McClellan is saying, which is the White House wanted to invade Iraq for theoretical reasons. Because establishing democracy there would somehow bring peace to the Middle East and make the world a better place. That is very, very hard to defend. In fact, I think it's borderline ludicrous.
If that's true, then I think, you know, historians have a stronger case that the Bush White House was, you know, negligent and acting against the best interests of the United States. But again, that's not a debate most people are interested in having. I mean, every survey shows, television ratings show, people don't want to revisit this. Most people think the war was a mistake. They don't want to hear about it. Which is why almost nobody covers the war any more. 
Wowee-wow-wow-wow.
Wow.
So McClellan's book "opens up a whole new line of questioning" regarding whether "the White House wanted to invade Iraq for theoretical reasons."
Gee, what a "new" line that would be. And in other news, if General Francisco Franco is still dead, that opens up a new line of questioning and...
This is a really tightly-packed one minute of bullshit, though.
First of all, what Tucker's really saying here is, "In order not to look like a total moron, I need to say that Scott McClellan might be saying something important here. But I can't throw the whole war and McCain under the bus just yet." So what he says is, oh, well, John McCain's position on the war is defensible. Preemptive war is defensible. But theoretical war -- however that differs from preemptive war -- is not. Bad White House! Unless, of course, you walk the war rationales back and say it was purely preemptive, which is "reasonable" and "defensible."
Anyone think the White House is going to be hesitant to do that?
Right. So the escape hatch is built right in. Tucker gets to be on TV being "relevant," gets to make the comments necessary in order for the host not to immediately dismiss him as being a moron, but then gets to wrap his comments in the blanket statement that if the White House will just say they were being reasonable, well then, they were being reasonable. Not like what this nutty guy is saying.
Second of all... historians ? Historians will have a stronger case that the Bush White House was negligent and acting against the best interests of the United States?
Why "historians?" Why would we be waiting on history here? Why wouldn't you say the Bush White House was negligent and acting against the best interests of the United States, Tucker? Why would that job fall to historians?
Third, here comes the set up. And oh baby, what a set up it is!
Nobody wants to hear about this! Nobody wants to revisit this! It's all in the past! Water under the bridge! It was a mistake! 4,000 dead and fifty years to go ("Maybe 100!"), but hey, look, we're rightfully chastened, we feel bad about it, but let's not get hung up on it. Let's look to the future.
Oh, man. Our future understanding of our immediate past is really gonna suck. ::

How big of a douchebag is David Brooks?
He's such a big douchebag that he tries to criticize Barack Obama as not being an oh-so-regular guy (just like the tortoise shell spectacled and pink necktied drip Brooks is, of course) by saying:
[H]e doesn‘t seem like a guy who can go into an Applebee‘s salad bar and people think he fits in naturally there. 
Only problem? David Brooks has apparently never stepped out of the limo and actually gone into an Applebees. Because they don't have salad bars.
Dumbass.
Excuse me, you're out of Low Fat Ranch. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you worked here, Mr. Regular Fellow! 
Oh, that Barack Obama! Why, he probably doesn't even know proper etiquette between chukkers at one of those "NASCAR" motoring exhibitions! (That's what the little people like these days, isn't it, Lovie?)

Is it the McCain campaign, a 527, or both? by BarbinMD Fri May 30, 2008 at 11:32:24 AM PDT
And the Straight Talk Express TM keeps rolling.  
With McCain aides dropping like flies over their lobbyist and special interest ties, a new zero tolerance policy was put in place by the McCain campaign. The new policy prohibits lobbyists (except his top advisors) and participants in 527’s from any involvement in his campaign.  And while the policy did force Senators Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman to step down from their advisory roles with a rightwing 527, Vets for Freedom , for some reason Wade Zirkle, a McCain "leadership team member," and Max Boot, an outside foreign policy advisor, are still lending their expertise to both the McCain campaign and to that very same 527...and it shows.  
John McCain : 
Sen. Obama has been to Iraq once. A little over two years ago, he went and he has never seized the opportunity except in a hearing to meet with General Petraeus. This is about leadership and learning. 
Vets for Freedom ad :
 The last time Barack Obama visited Iraq was in January 2006...Because he hasn't been there in over two years. Senator Obama, when will you go back to Iraq to see the progress firsthand. And when will you finally decide to meet one on one, unconditionally, with General Petraeus. 
John McCain :
 Now, why is it that Senator Obama wants to sit down with the President of Iran, but hasn't yet sat down with General Petraeus - the leader of our troops in Iraq? 
Vets for Freedom ad : 
 He wasn't available to meet with us, but we weren't surprised because he hasn't once sat down once, one-on-one, with our Commander in Iraq, General Petraeus...He's unwilling to get the facts on Iraq, yet he's willing to travel to Iran to meet with their leader or anyone else who hates our country. 
But hey, it's probably just a coincidence that McCain has two advisors working for a 527 whose message parrots what McCain is saying out on the campaign trail.  Because a campaign coordinating with a 527 would be wrong.  And illegal . ::

The Baby Blue Cherub mocks LA Times columnist Gregory Rodriguez for his latest paean to David Broder . I'm going to take a slightly different tack than Atrios.
Here's Rodriguez:
But these days, skeptics and the uncommitted are becoming few and far between. The number of voters in the middle has become smaller and smaller, and hence there are fewer people willing to hear what both sides have to say. 
There's been lots of definitions of "the middle" in elite punditry circles. The favorite seems to be, "split the difference between the Republican and Democratic positions". So if the Democrats want our troops out of Iraq in a year, and if McCain wants them out in 100 years, then the "middle" is apparently 50 years. Or something.
There's the David Broder definition of "the middle", which is essentially "what I, David Broder, think". That one is kind of fun. And what makes it particularly hilarious is that many of his peers in the Beltway also buy that definition, as they are madly in love with David Broder.
Rodriguez gives us a new one: "People who are undecided." It's novel. It's new. It's stupid. So it fits nicely into the universe of idiotic and nonsensical definitions of the "middle" that the punditry has been feeding us. Is it the stupidest? I think David Broder still rules supreme in that category.
But that's just a mater of of degree. Rodriguez is pretty darn stupid.
And for the record, my definition of "the middle" is the only one that makes sense: The political middle is the place where most Americans reside. Right now, progressives occupy the political middle on just about every issue except gay marriage (and the ground has been consistently shifting leftward on that front since civil unions became an acceptable alternative circa 2004). ::

Puerto Rico Results Thread #3 by kos Sun Jun 01, 2008 at 01:12:17 PM PDT
22 percent of districts reporting
           %   Del Clinton  67    10 Obama    33     4

Ben Smith :
Hillary's spending Monday night in New York City, a suggestion that she'll be having election night in her home state Tuesday.
That would be her first New York election night since Super Tuesday,when she won big states but, in retrospect, more or less lost the nomination. 
As Al Giordano notes , candidates suspend their elections at home. I don't know if we'll be that lucky, but it is curious that Clinton isn't spending the last few days campaigning in the last two primary states. It would suggest that she's given up on winning either Montana or South Dakota -- there aren't enough popular votes or delegates in those two last states to make a material impact on the Clintons' final argument -- that the super delegates should overturn the will of the voters and spark an intra-party civil war just because some polls suggest she runs slightly better.
If she was leading in either states, she'd be working overtime to prevent Obama from wrapping up the election with two solid victories. ::

TITLE: House and Senate Roundup, 6/6


TEXT:

House and Senate Roundup, 6/6 by brownsox Fri Jun 06, 2008 at 12:50:13 PM PDT
Senate Races
NM-Sen, MA-Sen, IA-Sen, SD-Sen : The Las Vegas Sun has an article today documenting the utter and abject failure of Nevada Sen. John Ensign's recruiting efforts this cycle.
John Ensign has a terrible job, and it got worse this week. 
The party that once dreamed of regaining their majority in one quick election cycle has now not only abandoned that prospect, but is despairing even about their chances in Louisiana, their only pickup opportunity:
Even before this week Ensign had stopped touting the "two-seat" campaign on the committee’s Web site — the two seats needed to overcome the Senate’s 51-49 division and give Republicans control.
In fact, Republicans no longer expect to win any Democratic-held seats.
"People up here tell me I’d be a hero if we held 45," Ensign said Thursday. Getting the majority "would be almost miraculous." 
It would be a miracle for the Republicans to lose four Senate seats? I suppose. The problem is, even that miracle won't be coming for this year's GOP.
Ensign bemoans the fact that several of the GOP's top recruiting targets, like Mike Rounds in North Dakota and Denny Rehberg in Montana. This, of course, ignores the fact that many of the recruits Ensign did snag proved their own suckitude in their primary races (like Heather Wilson in New Mexico and Steve Rathje in Iowa), or, in a supremely humiliating moment for Ensign's NRSC, couldn't even get on the Republican ballot (Jim Ogonowski in Massachusetts, here's looking at you).
NC-Sen : Kay Hagan wins the Best Snark of the Day award for this classic line on Elizabeth Dole, referencing Dole's controversial predecessor in her Senate seat as well as Dole's rather notable penchant for spending her time anywhere but North Carolina:
"If Jesse Helms was Senator No, then Elizabeth Dole is Senator Nowhere," she said. 
OK-Sen : Brave New Films has a video savaging James Inhofe's hypocritical record on veterans' issues. It's five and a half minutes long, and every second hits.

House Races
AK-AL : Everyone's favorite purveyors of right-wing anti-tax lunacy, the esteemed Club for Growth, has hopped into the Alaska Congressional race with alacrity, on behalf of Rep. Don Young's primary challenger. From Club captain Pat Toomey, in the Wall Street Journal :
Today, the Club for Growth Political Action Committee endorses Alaska Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell in his bid to unseat Republican Rep. Don Young in the state's August primary.
The reason for the endorsement is simple. Mr. Parnell is a solid conservative who led the fight for lower taxes and spending in the state legislature, and joined Gov. Sarah Palin in pushing for reform in the state. The man he is hoping to replace isn't economically conservative in the least. Mr. Young is actually a poster child for what has gone wrong with the Republican Party in Washington.
Over his 35 years in Congress, Mr. Young made himself into the most powerful Republican on the House Transportation Committee. But instead of using his power to steer Republicans down a principled, conservative track, he helped derail the GOP train in 2006. 
The rest of the article boils down to how Don Young sold the GOP down the river through his carnivorous love for pork, and his abandonment of "conservative principles", and what have you.
You know, that's a pretty convoluted article, considering that most Parnell supporters can boil their reasons for supporting him down to four words: "Don Young is dirty".
I'm hoping Young survives his primary, as he's a lovely target for Democrat Ethan Berkowitz in the fall, while Berkowitz would have his hands full with Parnell.
OH-02 : Take these with a barrel of salt, but one poll shows Democrat Vic Wulsin beating incumbent Republican Jean Schmidt, 30% to 24%, with independent David Krikorian garnering 13%.
From James at SSP:
The poll also shows that Schmidt has a job approval rating of 23%, and Bush at 40%. But this is one weird poll, and frankly, the numbers seem a little suspect. Was there any attempt made to push leaners?
Here's a "bonus finding" from the poll: Obama leads McCain by 34-33 in Ohio's 2nd CD. Let the record show that this is an R+13 district.
These numbers just seem too hard to believe. 
I agree. I just can't believe that Schmidt, unpopular as she is, has only 24% reelects in an R+13 district, even if practically no effort was made to push leaners.
I can believe that Wulsin is competitive and may- maybe -even be leading slightly, but I don't really know what to make of this poll.
AZ-03 : Sensing a strong challenge from Democrat Bob Lord, amid reports that his own reelect numbers are abysmal for a seven-term incumbent, Republican Rep. John Shadegg is bringing in some heavy hitters to help him raise cash . Those would be Arizona's junior Senator, Jon Kyl, and the (very) senior Senator, presidential nominee John McCain.
Calling Bob Lord "well-funded, serious opposition" to Rep. John Shadegg (R-3), Sens. John McCain and John Kyl will host a fundraiser on Shadegg's behalf at the home of attorney Jordan Rose and husband, Rose & Allyn Public Relations partner Jason Rose on Saturday afternoon. 
Taking out a guy as heinous as Shadegg, in a district as Republican as this one is, truly is its own reward.
But if Lord manages to pull it off, he will have the added glory of having defeated a McCain crony in McCain's old district with McCain's full support.
FL-13 : Landslide Vern Buchanan, who narrowly squeaked by Democrat Christine Jennings in 2006 predominantly due to bad electronic ballot design, faces Jennings again this fall, and currently finds himself in some scalding hot water :
The latest in a series of lawsuits against Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) alleging consumer fraud at car dealerships he owns was filed last week, turning up the heat on the freshman lawmaker and setting the stage for a long, hot summer in central Florida.
Individuals close to the lawsuits are also signaling that allegations of campaign finance violations by Buchanan could become a key plank in the growing caseload against the lawmaker — lawsuits that could number seven by July 1.
Those charges are expected to include the illegal funneling of dealership money last cycle into Buchanan’s campaign account. 
That's seven lawsuits expected against Buchanan. Tom DeLay would be proud.
Buchanan, it seems, is not just guilty of illegal business practices, but of illegally channeling his dirty money into his campaign, according to Joseph Kezer, former finance director at one of Buchanan's car dealerships:
Kezer also alleged in an interview with Roll Call that he observed campaign finance violations ahead of Buchanan’s narrow 2006 victory against bank executive Christine Jennings (D). In the most expensive House race last cycle, Buchanan spent more than $5 million of his own money, according to CQ MoneyLine, to win by 369 votes.
Buchanan is expected to face a rematch with Jennings in November.
Some of the Buchanan campaign’s record $8 million outlay in the 2006 campaign, according to Kezer, likely was laundered corporate cash funneled through higher-ups at Buchanan’s numerous dealerships. 
These are very serious allegations, and the mounting number of lawsuits can't possibly be good for the reelection hopes of a man who barely squeezed into office in the first place. ::

TITLE: Lots of undecideds in Michigan as Obama lags

Lots of undecideds in Michigan as Obama lags by kos Thu May 29, 2008 at 10:40:26 AM PDT
SurveyUSA . 5/27-28. Likely voters. MoE 4.3%             Tot   Men Wom   Whi Bla   Rep Dem Ind
5/27-28 Obama  (D)   37    30  44    34  62    10  60  37 McCain (R)   41    48  36    43  26    78  18  37
2/26-28 Obama  (D)   46    43  49    39  88    13  76  43 McCain (R)   45    51  39    51  10    83  16  45

Only 62-26 among black voters? That'll change. The poll also has the black sample at 13 percent, which matches the 2004 exit poll numbers. Pollsters have to guess at such turnout in 2008, and historical guides are as good as any. But in this case, I suspect they're undercounting black turnout.
Overall not a great result, but not panic inducing. Like in many states, it comes down to bringing home the Democratic vote. If Obama starts consolidating support in the party, as is likely, things will look good. If his Democratic support remains this weak, he's in trouble.
One other interesting point in this poll -- the undecided percentages has gone way up among all sub-groups. Overall, this poll's undecided is at a huge 21 percent -- particularly big for SUSA which normally pushes leaners. This is compared 11 percent a month ago. That extra 10 percent of undecideds has come disproportionately from Obama's numbers, suggesting that his soft support has peeled off for now as those voters assess the candidates. ::

TITLE: It depends what your definition of "his" is

It depends what your definition of "his" is by BarbinMD Mon May 26, 2008 at 03:05:15 PM PDT
Now that John McCain has rejected the endorsement of Rod "It’s America’s destiny to destroy Islam" Parsley, and Parsley has taken back that endorsement, it seems that there is one point that should be clarified.  
It was just a few short months ago that McCain said that Parsley was:
... one of the truly great leaders in America, a moral compass, a spiritual guide, Pastor Rod Parsley. 
But now that McCain is rejecting Mr. Parsley for his hateful rhetoric, how does the McCain campaign explain those earlier, glowing words?   Easy.  According to a McCain spokesman, McCain said that Parsley was: 
...a spiritual guide, not his  spiritual guide. 
And the Straight Talk Express TM is leaving the station... ::
