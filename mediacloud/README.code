This code consists primarily of a Catalyst web app that manages the media
sources and feeds that Media Cloud processes and of a collection of stand
alone scripts that download, extract, index, and tag the content of those
media sources and feeds.

Here's a brief road map of the code included in this release:

* script/* - command line scripts that run the various aspects of the system.

* script/mediawords.sql - sql definition of postgres database

* script/mediawords_server.pl - run the stand alone version of the catalyst
  web application (which as with any catalyst app can also run via cgi, fcgi,
  or mod_perl)

* script/mediawords_crawl.pl - crawl the web for the feeds entered into the
  web application.

* script/mediawords_extract_text.pl - extract the substantive text from and
  add tags to all newly downloaded content.
  
  
* script/mediawords_update_story_vectors.pl - index all extracted text in
  the postgres full text search system and create the word index that 
  supports the topic explorer word frequency analysis.
  
* script/mediawords_generate_topic_reports.pl - generate the word cloud / 
  topic reports.  
  
* script/mediawords_create_* - create the denormalized tables for the
  mediacloud.org top ten visualizations.

* lib/* - perl modules that implement the bulk of the functionality of the
  system.

* lib/MediaWords/Controller/* - catalyst controller classes that implement
  the various pages of the web app.
  
* lib/MediaWords/Crawler/* - crawler implementation

* lib/MediaWords/Crawler/Extractor.pm - text extraction implementation

* lib/MediaWords/DB.pm - database connection details

* lib/DBIx/Simple/MediaWords.pm - local sub class of DBIx::Simple that
  Media Cloud uses for database access
  
* lib/Bundle/MediaWords.pm - cpan bundle with the modules used by Media Cloud

* lib/Feed/Scrape.pm - scrape rss/atom feeds from an html page

* lib/MediaWords/Pager.pm - find next page link in a web page

* lib/MediaWords/Tagger.pm Tagger/*.pm - return a set of tags from a block
  of text

* data/ - directory for all data files, including downloaded content and 
  support files for tagging systems
  
* data/content - directory where all downloaded content is stored.  On our 
  production system, this directory has about 500G of content after
  9 months of downloading ~1500 feeds.
