This is the source code for the Media Cloud system.  Media Cloud is a project
of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University that is
archiving and analyzing news stories and blog posts from around the web in
order to understand better how news flows through the Internet.

For more information on Media Cloud, go to http://mediacloud.org.

The Media Cloud code here does three things:

* Runs a web app that allows you to manage a set of media sources and their
  feeds.
  
* Periodically crawls the feeds setup within the web app and downloads any
  new stories found within the downloaded feeds.
  
* Extracts the substantive text from the downloaded story content (minus
  the ads, navigation, comments, etc) and associates a set of tags
  with each story based on that extracted text.

We have been running this code for a year now, but this is an alpha release
of the code and is not packaged to be easy to install or run. For very brief 
installation instructions, see INSTALL.

Please send us a note at info@mediacloud.org if you are using any of this
code or if you have any questions.  We are very interested in knowing who's 
using the code and for what.

For a brief roadmap of the code contained in this release, see README.code.
